    "Of course. Here is a detailed and robust prompt designed to perform intent analysis and classify queries, encapsulated within a Python multi-line string.\n",

    "This prompt is structured with a clear role, a primary goal, nuanced definitions, and specific rules for handling the conflicting conditions you identified, making it highly effective and less prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"\"\"\n",
    "You are an expert AI assistant specializing in semantic analysis for the talent acquisition and executive search industry. You have a deep understanding of the nuances that differentiate a query intended for hiring from a query intended for market research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary task is to analyze a user's query, determine its underlying intent, and classify it as either a 'Recruiting Query' or a 'Search/Research Query'. You must base your decision on a deep analysis of the query's semantics, not just on superficial keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Recruiting Query:**\n",
    "    * **Primary Intent:** To find *people to hire* for a specific role, either explicitly stated or implied.\n",
    "    * **Language:** The language is **transactional and action-oriented**. It often includes phrases like \"I am looking for,\" \"Find me candidates,\" \"suitable for,\" or implies a need to fill a position.\n",
    "    * **Focus:** The query is **person-centric**. The ultimate subject is an individual or a group of potential candidates.\n",
    "    * **Contextual Clues:** It may contain criteria related to a candidate's career journey, such as \"step-up\" potential ($VP \\rightarrow CFO$), or use company attributes (e.g., \"PE-backed,\" \"multibillion dollar\") as a proxy for required *candidate experience*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Search/Research Query:**\n",
    "    * **Primary Intent:** To gather *information or data* about a market, a list of companies, or a general group of people for analysis, not for immediate hiring.\n",
    "    * **Language:** The language is **informational and exploratory**. It often includes phrases like \"List of,\" \"What are,\" \"search for,\" or simply states the entity of interest.\n",
    "    * **Focus:** The query is **entity-centric**. The ultimate subject can be companies, market trends, or a broad demographic.\n",
    "    * **Contextual Clues:** The filters used are purely descriptive of a market segment (e.g., \"hospitals in Alaska,\" \"companies in logistics\"). There is no mention or implication of a candidate's career progression or fit for a specific, unstated client.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Rules for Handling Ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "You must follow these rules to resolve conflicts and correctly classify difficult queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rule 1: Job Titles Are Not a Decisive Signal.**\n",
    "    * Both query types can contain job titles. Do NOT classify a query as 'Recruiting' just because it contains a title like \"CFO\" or \"VP.\" You must find stronger, corroborating evidence of hiring intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rule 2: Identify the Ultimate Subject.**\n",
    "    * Analyze the query's syntax. Is the goal a list of *people* or a list of *companies/entities*?\n",
    "    * *Example:* \"Find me **CEOs** at PE-backed companies\" is about a person (Recruiting). \"List **PE-backed companies**\" is about an entity (Search/Research).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rule 3: Implicit Hiring Intent is Key (The Sourcing Rule).**\n",
    "    * **This is the most important rule.** The first stage of recruiting is called \"sourcing\" or \"market mapping,\" which often uses the language of research.\n",
    "    * If a query seeks a list of *specific people* defined by their professional titles, skills, and company types, it has a **strong implicit hiring intent** because the goal is to build a candidate pipeline.\n",
    "    * Therefore, you MUST classify these sourcing queries as **Recruiting Queries**, even if they use words like \"list,\" \"search for,\" or \"look for.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "You must provide your response in the following structured format. Do not add any conversational text outside of this structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification:** `[Your classification: \"Recruiting Query\" or \"Search/Research Query\"]`\n",
    "**Confidence:** `[A score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating your confidence]`\n",
    "**Reasoning:** `[A step-by-step explanation for your classification. Reference the Core Definitions and Critical Rules above to justify your decision.]`\n",
    "**Key Signals:** `[A list of the specific words or phrases from the query that led you to your conclusion.]`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1 Query:** \"I am looking for Regional Finance Directors in Latin America with international experience and ideally in an industry related to fruit and vegetable production.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification:** `Recruiting Query`\n",
    "**Confidence:** `1.0`\n",
    "**Reasoning:** `The query uses the transactional phrase \"I am looking for,\" making the intent explicitly about finding a person. It specifies a role (\"Regional Finance Directors\"), a location, and required candidate experiences (\"international experience,\" \"fruit and vegetable production\"). This aligns perfectly with the definition of a Recruiting Query.`\n",
    "**Key Signals:** `[\"I am looking for\", \"Regional Finance Directors\", \"with international experience\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2 Query:** \"PE-backed companies in logistics\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification:** `Search/Research Query`\n",
    "**Confidence:** `1.0`\n",
    "**Reasoning:** `The query's ultimate subject is \"companies,\" not people. It is a request for a list of entities based on descriptive market traits (\"PE-backed,\" \"in logistics\"). It lacks any language indicating hiring intent. This aligns with the definition of a Search/Research Query.`\n",
    "**Key Signals:** `[\"companies\", \"in logistics\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3 Query:** \"Look for vice presidents of medical economics who currently or in the past worked for companies like Anthem, Aetna, or Elevance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification:** `Recruiting Query`\n",
    "**Confidence:** `0.95`\n",
    "**Reasoning:** `While the query uses the exploratory phrase \"Look for,\" its ultimate subject is a list of specific people (\"vice presidents of medical economics\"). It specifies professional titles and target companies, which is a classic sourcing technique to build a candidate pipeline.

    "    - After correctly identifying all the required modifications write a `modification_prompt` will be treated as an instruction describing how the previous filters should be modified (e.g., \"Change location to USA\", \"Remove skills\", \"Add age 50+ and location Europe\").\n",
    "    - **The modification_prompt should be a direct and straight-forward instruction**: \"Add this\", \"Change this\", etc.**\n",
    "    - If can **NEVER** detect ambiguity, or **ASK ANY QUESTIONS**.\n",
    "    - If unsure, You MUST assume the most **plausible and relevant meanings** according to the context, and must always write a modification_prompt.\n",
    "    - **Don't miss any details: Don't shorten or summarize important details, such as certain descriptions of companies or other requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Guidelines:\n",
    "    - Review everything: Look at the <Last_Query> in light of the entire conversation.\n",
    "    - Include all details: Don't miss any information or requirements.\n",
    "    - Be clear: Use straightforward language.\n",
    "    - Keep specifics: Don't shorten or summarize important details.\n",
    "    - If some details for specific companies are given, you must include them in the modification_prompt as well.\n",
    "    - If anything in the <Last_Query> is ambiguous, you must assume the most **plausible and relevant meanings** and write the modification_prompt accordingly.\n",
