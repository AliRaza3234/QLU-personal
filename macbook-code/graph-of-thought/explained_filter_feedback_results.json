        "reasoning_and_analysis": "1. **DETAILED ANALYSIS**\n\nThe integration of these solutions involves understanding and interpreting the requirements, feedback, and existing filter values to ensure the final filters are comprehensive and precise. The main components to consider are job title specificity, broadening location scope, incorporating past sales experience, and ensuring candidates have scaling experience in AI-driven SaaS platforms.\n\n- **Job Title Specificity**: The feedback emphasizes the need to strictly filter for \"Chief Marketing Officer\" (CMO) to avoid non-CMO profiles. This requires refining the job title filters to include both the full title and its common abbreviation.\n\n- **Location Scope**: The feedback suggests broadening the candidate pool beyond the U.S. while still considering U.S.-based candidates. This requires expanding the location filters to include international regions alongside the U.S.\n\n- **Sales Experience**: The requirement is for candidates to have past sales experience, necessitating filters for past job titles or functions related to sales.\n\n- **Scaling Experience in AI-driven SaaS**: The candidates should have demonstrable experience in scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms, which requires refining skills filters and possibly incorporating tenure filters to validate sustained success.\n\n2. **REASONING FOR EACH FILTER**\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**:\n  - **Current**: Include \"Chief Marketing Officer\" and \"CMO\" to ensure specificity.\n  - **Past**: Add sales-related titles like \"Sales Manager,\" \"Sales Executive,\" and \"Account Executive\" to capture past sales experience.\n  - **Event**: Set to \"CURRENT AND PAST\" to ensure candidates meet both the current CMO role and have past sales experience.\n\n- **Location**:\n  - **Both**: Include \"United States,\" \"Europe,\" \"Asia,\" and \"Australia\" to broaden the candidate pool while retaining U.S. candidates.\n  - **Event**: Set to \"CURRENT OR PAST\" to consider candidates currently or previously in these locations.\n\n- **Skills**: Refine to include \"scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms,\" \"growth strategy for SaaS,\" and \"AI platform scaling\" to target the required experience.\n\n3. **ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS**\n\n- **Assumptions**:\n  - Candidates with past sales roles have relevant experience that contributes to their capability as a CMO in scaling platforms.\n  - Including a broad range of international locations will address feedback about too many U.S.-based candidates.\n\n- **Implications**:\n  - The refined job title filter will significantly reduce non-CMO profiles, improving the relevance of search results.\n  - Broadening location filters may increase the diversity of candidates but might require additional language or cultural considerations.\n\n4. **VALIDATION CHECKS**\n\n- Ensure the system recognizes both \"Chief Marketing Officer\" and \"CMO\" as equivalent.\n- Confirm that the location filters accurately reflect the desired regions.\n- Validate that the skills filter captures the essence of scaling experience.\n- Check that past sales role filters are correctly applied to past job experiences.\n\n5. **FEEDBACK INCORPORATION**\n\n- The feedback about non-CMO candidates has been addressed by refining the job title filter.\n- The feedback about broadening the candidate pool beyond the U.S. has been incorporated by expanding the location filter.\n- The need for past sales experience has been integrated through specific past job title filters.\n\n6. **FINAL FILTER JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [\n            {\"title_name\": \"Chief Marketing Officer\", \"min_staff\": 1, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"CMO\", \"min_staff\": 1, \"max_staff\": 50000000}\n        ],\n        \"past\": [\n            {\"title_name\": \"Sales Manager\", \"min_staff\": 1, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Sales Executive\", \"min_staff\": 1, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Account Executive\", \"min_staff\": 1, \"max_staff\": 50000000}\n        ],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT AND PAST\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [\n            {\"name\": \"United States\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Europe\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Asia\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Australia\"}\n        ],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [\n        {\"name\": \"scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms\"},\n        {\"name\": \"growth strategy for SaaS\"},\n        {\"name\": \"AI platform scaling\"}\n    ]\n}\n```\nThis final JSON structure integrates all aspects of the solutions while addressing feedback and incorporating existing filter values effectively.",
