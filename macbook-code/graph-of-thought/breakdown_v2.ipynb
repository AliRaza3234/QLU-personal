FEEDBACK FOCUS: Deeply analyze any provided feedback and make it the central guiding principle of your analysis\\n        2. ATOMICITY: Break down queries into truly atomic sub-problems (each addressing ONE specific aspect only)\\n        3. FILTER AWARENESS: Carefully consider existing filter values when analyzing the query\\n        4. INTENT UNDERSTANDING: Comprehend the main intent of the recruitment query\\n        \\n        Key principles for FEEDBACK incorporation:\\n        - Treat feedback as the highest priority guidance for your analysis\\n        - Explicitly connect each piece of feedback to specific atomic sub-problems\\n        - If feedback contradicts the original query, prioritize the feedback's direction\\n        - Use feedback to refine, modify, or completely change your understanding of requirements\\n        - For each atomic sub-problem, include SPECIFIC quotes from the feedback that are relevant\\n        \\n        Key principles for ATOMIC SUB-PROBLEM creation:\\n        - Each sub-problem must address EXACTLY ONE specific requirement or concept\\n        - If a potential sub-problem addresses multiple requirements, split it further\\n        - Test each sub-problem with the question: \\\"Does this solve exactly one thing?\\\"\\n        - Avoid compound requirements within a single sub-problem\\n        - Ensure each sub-problem has a singular, clear focus\\n        \\n        For each ATOMIC sub-problem, you must:\\n        1. Focus on a single, specific aspect of the requirement\\n        2. Connect relevant feedback specifically to this atomic element\\n        3. Identify which specific filter values (if any) relate to this single element\\n        4. Assign appropriate priority (1-5, 1 being highest)\\n        5. Explicitly state dependencies on other atomic sub-problems\\n        \\n        Your analysis process should follow these steps:\\n        1. First, thoroughly analyze the feedback to identify key guidance points\\n        2. Second, examine existing filter values to understand constraints\\n        3. Third, break down the query into the smallest possible atomic sub-problems\\n        4.

      "- **Reasoning:** The original context specifies a Germany-based candidate. The best approach is to ensure the filter precisely matches candidates currently located in Germany.\n",
      "- **Timeline:** \"Current\" is appropriate since the location needs to reflect where the candidate is now.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Job Title\n",
      "- **Reasoning:** \"Communications Director\" is the specific title required. Including both current and past titles ensures a wider pool of candidates.\n",
      "- **Timeline:** \"Both\" covers all relevant candidates who have had the role at any time.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Industry and Company\n",
      "- **Reasoning:** Candidates must have experience in premium FMCG companies. A combination of industry and company filters ensures precise targeting.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "- We assume that the location data is accurate and that candidates are tagged correctly in the backend.\n",
      "- For the job title, we assume that \"Communications Director\" captures all relevant role designations.\n",
      "- Premium FMCG is assumed to be a distinct segment that can be clearly differentiated from non-premium FMCG.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Location:** Ensure \"Germany\" is correctly represented in `location_full_path`.\n",
      "- **Job Title:** Confirm that \"Communications Director\" is matched in `experience.title`.\n",
      "- **Industry and Company:** Verify that \"Premium FMCG\" and specific companies are accurately tagged.\n",

      "### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n",
      "\n",
      "- No specific feedback was provided. The focus remains on implementing the filters accurately.\n",

      "### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Location:** `location_full_path` in the backend correctly maps to Germany.\n",
      "- **Job Title:** `experience.title` matches \"Communications Director.\"\n",

REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\\n\\n#### Location\\n- **Reasoning:** The original context specifies a Germany-based candidate. The best approach is to ensure the filter precisely matches candidates currently located in Germany.\\n- **Timeline:** \\\"Current\\\" is appropriate since the location needs to reflect where the candidate is now.\\n\\n#### Job Title\\n- **Reasoning:** \\\"Communications Director\\\" is the specific title required. Including both current and past titles ensures a wider pool of candidates.\\n- **Timeline:** \\\"Both\\\" covers all relevant candidates who have had the role at any time.\\n\\n#### Industry and Company\\n- **Reasoning:** Candidates must have experience in premium FMCG companies. A combination of industry and company filters ensures precise targeting.\\n- **Timeline:** \\\"Current or Past\\\" ensures all relevant experiences are included.\\n\\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\\n\\n- We assume that the location data is accurate and that candidates are tagged correctly in the backend.\\n- For the job title, we assume that \\\"Communications Director\\\" captures all relevant role designations.\\n- Premium FMCG is assumed to be a distinct segment that can be clearly differentiated from non-premium FMCG.\\n\\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\\n\\n- **Location:** Ensure \\\"Germany\\\" is correctly represented in `location_full_path`.\\n- **Job Title:** Confirm that \\\"Communications Director\\\" is matched in `experience.title`.\\n- **Industry and Company:** Verify that \\\"Premium FMCG\\\" and specific companies are accurately tagged.\\n\\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\\n\\n- No specific feedback was provided. The focus remains on implementing the filters accurately.\\n\\n### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\\n\\n- **Location:** `location_full_path` in the backend correctly maps to Germany.\\n- **Job Title:** `experience.title` matches \\\"Communications Director.\\\"\\n- **Industry and Company:** `experience.company_industry` and `experience.company` will be used to filter premium FMCG experiences.\\n\\n### 7.

FILTER AWARENESS: Carefully consider existing filter values when analyzing the query\\n        4. INTENT UNDERSTANDING: Comprehend the main intent of the recruitment query\\n        \\n        Key principles for FEEDBACK incorporation:\\n        - Treat feedback as the highest priority guidance for your analysis\\n        - Explicitly connect each piece of feedback to specific atomic sub-problems\\n        - If feedback contradicts the original query, prioritize the feedback's direction\\n        - Use feedback to refine, modify, or completely change your understanding of requirements\\n        - For each atomic sub-problem, include SPECIFIC quotes from the feedback that are relevant\\n        \\n        Key principles for ATOMIC SUB-PROBLEM creation:\\n        - Each sub-problem must address EXACTLY ONE specific requirement or concept\\n        - If a potential sub-problem addresses multiple requirements, split it further\\n        - Test each sub-problem with the question: \\\"Does this solve exactly one thing?\\\"\\n        - Avoid compound requirements within a single sub-problem\\n        - Ensure each sub-problem has a singular, clear focus\\n        \\n        For each ATOMIC sub-problem, you must:\\n        1.

Analyze all solutions thoroughly\\n        2. Provide detailed reasoning for each decision\\n        3. Convert the solutions into the exact filter format\\n        4. Only include relevant filters with valid values\\n        5. Ensure all values are logically consistent\\n        6. Consider feedback and existing filter values in your integration\\n\\n        ## FILTER SYSTEM REFERENCE GUIDE\\n        This comprehensive guide explains how filters are mapped to backend data:\\n\\n        1. SKILL/KEYWORDS\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'summary', 'skills', 'headline', 'experience.title', and 'experience.job_summary'\\n        - Note: Skills are matched in all titles and job summaries regardless of timeline\\n\\n        2. INDUSTRY\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.company_description', 'experience.company_industry', 'experience.company_speciality', 'experience.title', and 'experience.job_summary'\\n        - Timeline options:\\n          * Current: Matched where 'experience.end' is null\\n          * Past: Matched where 'experience.end' is not null\\n          * Current or Past: Ignores 'experience.end' and matches all\\n          * Current and Past: Matches where 'experience.end' is null AND where not null\\n\\n        3. COMPANY\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.company'\\n        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\\n\\n        4. LOCATION\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'location_full_path'\\n        - Timeline options apply when combined with other filters\\n\\n        5. JOB_TITLE/BUSINESS_FUNCTION\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.title'\\n        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\\n        - May include company size check on number of people at the company\\n\\n        6. MANAGEMENT_LEVEL\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.title'\\n        - Important note: For C-Suites, all titles that lie in C-Suites are matched. For Director, the substring \\\"Director\\\" is matched.\\n        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\\n\\n        7. EDUCATION/SCHOOL/DEGREE\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'education' array of objects\\n\\n        8. EXPERIENCE FILTERS (TENURE)\\n        - TOTAL_WORKING_YEARS: Matched against 'total_tenure' (expressed in days in backend)\\n        - COMPANY_TENURE: Calculated for current company where 'experience.end' is null\\n        - ROLE_TENURE: Calculated for current role where 'experience.end' is null\\n\\n        ## IMPORTANT FILTER RELATIONS\\n        \\n        1. Job Title and Management Level\\n           - Both are mapped to 'experience.title'\\n           - Their relation is AND\\n           - Example: If Job Title is 'Sales' and Management Level is 'Director', both substrings must be present in 'experience.title'\\n        \\n        2. Ternary Relations\\n           - The system uses this relation: (Industry OR Companies) AND Job Title AND Management Level AND Skills AND Location AND Experience\\n           - This determines how multiple filters interact with each other\\n\\n        The final output must strictly follow this filter structure:\\n        {\\n            \\\"job_title/business_function\\\": {\\n                \\\"current\\\": [{\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}],\\n                \\\"past\\\": [{\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}],\\n                \\\"both\\\": [{\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}],\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"  # Can only be \\\"CURRENT\\\", \\\"PAST\\\", \\\"CURRENT OR PAST\\\", \\\"CURRENT AND PAST\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"management_level\\\": {\\n                \\\"current\\\": [],\\n                \\\"past\\\": [],\\n                \\\"both\\\": [],\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"location\\\": {\\n                \\\"current\\\": [],\\n                \\\"past\\\": [],\\n                \\\"both\\\": [],\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"company\\\": {\\n                \\\"current_prompt\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n                \\\"past_prompt\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"education\\\": [{\\\"degree\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"major\\\": \\\"\\\"}],\\n            \\\"school\\\": [],\\n            \\\"current_ownership\\\": [],\\n            \\\"name\\\": [],\\n            \\\"ethnicity\\\": [],\\n            \\\"age\\\": [],\\n            \\\"total_working_years\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n            \\\"role_tenure\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n            \\\"company_tenure\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n            \\\"skills\\\": []\\n        }\\n\\n        Before providing the final JSON:\\n        1.

      "### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Solution 1: Site Manager Role\n",
      "- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: This solution emphasizes the 'Site Manager' role across current and past experiences. It maps to the `job_title/business_function` filter with \"Current and Past\" as the timeline.\n",
      "- **Explicit Requirements**: Identify candidates with experience as a 'Site Manager'.\n",
      "- **Temporal Aspect**: Includes both current and past roles for comprehensive coverage.\n",
      "- **Logical Dependencies**: This job title must coexist with the 'Director' role and relevant operational roles.\n",
      "- **Potential Conflicts**: Broad coverage might include outdated experience.\n",
      "- **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback, so the focus is on capturing all relevant experience.\n",
      "- **Existing Filter Influence**: Ensures compatibility with other roles requiring operational expertise.\n",
      "- **Backend Processing**: Matches in 'experience.title' for both current and past experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Solution 2: Director Role\n",
      "- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: The 'Director' title is included under `job_title/business_function` with \"Current or Past\" timeline.\n",
      "- **Explicit Requirements**: Ensure 'Director' is present in job titles.\n",
      "- **Temporal Aspect**: Covers both current and past experiences.\n",
      "- **Logical Dependencies**: Must be combined with 'Site Manager' in an AND relation.\n",
      "- **Potential Conflicts**: None identified; aligns well with other titles.\n",
      "- **Feedback Influence**: Direct focus on 'Director' without additional constraints.\n",
      "- **Existing Filter Influence**: Supports the requirement for management roles.\n",
      "- **Backend Processing**: Matches 'experience.title' across all experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Solution 3: US-based Companies\n",
      "- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Uses the `location` filter set to \"United States\" for both current and past experiences.\n",
      "- **Explicit Requirements**: Ensure companies are US-based.\n",
      "- **Temporal Aspect**: Matches any experience linked to US-based companies.\n",
      "- **Logical Dependencies**: Must align with other filters to ensure company relevance.\n",
      "- **Potential Conflicts**: None; straightforward geographic constraint.\n",
      "- **Feedback Influence**: No feedback; simple geographic specification.\n",
      "- **Existing Filter Influence**: Aligns with company location requirements.\n",
      "- **Backend Processing**: Matches 'location_full_path' for US-based companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Solution 4: Revenue Over 1 Million Dollars\n",
      "- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Uses a creative interpretation of the `company` filter with a prompt specifying revenue.\n",
      "- **Explicit Requirements**: Companies must generate over 1 million dollars.\n",
      "- **Temporal Aspect**: Assumes relevance for current and past companies.\n",
      "- **Logical Dependencies**: Works in conjunction with US-based companies.\n",
      "- **Potential Conflicts**: Backend capability to interpret revenue prompts.\n",
      "- **Feedback Influence**: No direct feedback; relies on backend interpretation.\n",
      "- **Existing Filter Influence**: Utilizes existing company metadata as a proxy.\n",
      "- **Backend Processing**: Relies on backend's ability to interpret prompts related to company revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Solution 5: Operational Domain\n",
      "- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Uses `job_title/business_function` to capture roles like 'Site Manager', 'Operations Director', and 'Extraction Supervisor'.\n",
      "- **Explicit Requirements**: Focus on operational functions at extraction sites.\n",
      "- **Temporal Aspect**: Includes roles across all timelines for comprehensive coverage.\n",
      "- **Logical Dependencies**: Interacts with industry and skills for complete domain specification.\n",
      "- **Potential Conflicts**: Ensures roles are correctly identified as operational.\n",
      "- **Feedback Influence**: None; directly implements the operational role requirement.\n",
      "- **Existing Filter Influence**: Complements roles in extraction and operations.\n",
      "- **Backend Processing**: Matches titles related to operational functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Job Title/Business Function**: Must include 'Site Manager', 'Director', and operational roles like 'Operations Director', matching both current and past experiences.\n",
      "- **Management Level**: 'Director' role must be present, ensuring the role's management level is captured.\n",
      "- **Location**: Must be set to \"United States\" to ensure US-based company association.\n",
      "- **Company**: Needs a prompt to identify companies generating over 1 million dollars.\n",
      "- **Skills/Industry**: While not explicitly mentioned, operational roles imply relevant skills and industries should be inferred.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n",
      "- Assumed backend can interpret company prompts related to revenue.\n",
      "- Assumed 'Director' involves management level responsibilities.\n",
      "- Implicitly, roles are in petroleum or similar industries due to the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n",
      "- Ensure all job titles have an AND relation with management levels.\n",
      "- Validate geographic and revenue constraints are properly interpreted.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n",
      "- Feedback was minimal; focus was on complete and accurate translation of requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n",
      "- Verified all filters align with backend data structure and requirements.\n",

DETAILED ANALYSIS\\n\\n#### Solution 1: Site Manager Role\\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: This solution emphasizes the 'Site Manager' role across current and past experiences. It maps to the `job_title/business_function` filter with \\\"Current and Past\\\" as the timeline.\\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Identify candidates with experience as a 'Site Manager'.\\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Includes both current and past roles for comprehensive coverage.\\n- **Logical Dependencies**: This job title must coexist with the 'Director' role and relevant operational roles.\\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Broad coverage might include outdated experience.\\n- **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback, so the focus is on capturing all relevant experience.\\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Ensures compatibility with other roles requiring operational expertise.\\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches in 'experience.title' for both current and past experiences.\\n\\n#### Solution 2: Director Role\\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: The 'Director' title is included under `job_title/business_function` with \\\"Current or Past\\\" timeline.\\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Ensure 'Director' is present in job titles.\\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Covers both current and past experiences.\\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Must be combined with 'Site Manager' in an AND relation.\\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None identified; aligns well with other titles.\\n- **Feedback Influence**: Direct focus on 'Director' without additional constraints.\\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Supports the requirement for management roles.\\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches 'experience.title' across all experiences.\\n\\n#### Solution 3: US-based Companies\\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Uses the `location` filter set to \\\"United States\\\" for both current and past experiences.\\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Ensure companies are US-based.\\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Matches any experience linked to US-based companies.\\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Must align with other filters to ensure company relevance.\\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None; straightforward geographic constraint.\\n- **Feedback Influence**: No feedback; simple geographic specification.\\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Aligns with company location requirements.\\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches 'location_full_path' for US-based companies.\\n\\n#### Solution 4: Revenue Over 1 Million Dollars\\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Uses a creative interpretation of the `company` filter with a prompt specifying revenue.\\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Companies must generate over 1 million dollars.\\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Assumes relevance for current and past companies.\\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Works in conjunction with US-based companies.\\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Backend capability to interpret revenue prompts.\\n- **Feedback Influence**: No direct feedback; relies on backend interpretation.\\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Utilizes existing company metadata as a proxy.\\n- **Backend Processing**: Relies on backend's ability to interpret prompts related to company revenue.\\n\\n#### Solution 5: Operational Domain\\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Uses `job_title/business_function` to capture roles like 'Site Manager', 'Operations Director', and 'Extraction Supervisor'.\\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Focus on operational functions at extraction sites.\\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Includes roles across all timelines for comprehensive coverage.\\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Interacts with industry and skills for complete domain specification.\\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Ensures roles are correctly identified as operational.\\n- **Feedback Influence**: None; directly implements the operational role requirement.\\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Complements roles in extraction and operations.\\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches titles related to operational functions.\\n\\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\\n\\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: Must include 'Site Manager', 'Director', and operational roles like 'Operations Director', matching both current and past experiences.\\n- **Management Level**: 'Director' role must be present, ensuring the role's management level is captured.\\n- **Location**: Must be set to \\\"United States\\\" to ensure US-based company association.\\n- **Company**: Needs a prompt to identify companies generating over 1 million dollars.\\n- **Skills/Industry**: While not explicitly mentioned, operational roles imply relevant skills and industries should be inferred.\\n\\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\\n- Assumed backend can interpret company prompts related to revenue.\\n- Assumed 'Director' involves management level responsibilities.\\n- Implicitly, roles are in petroleum or similar industries due to the context.\\n\\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\\n- Ensure all job titles have an AND relation with management levels.\\n- Validate geographic and revenue constraints are properly interpreted.\\n\\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\\n- Feedback was minimal; focus was on complete and accurate translation of requirements.\\n\\n### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\\n- Verified all filters align with backend data structure and requirements.\\n\\n### 7.

Consider feedback and existing filter values in your integration\\n\\n        ## FILTER SYSTEM REFERENCE GUIDE\\n        This comprehensive guide explains how filters are mapped to backend data:\\n\\n        1. SKILL/KEYWORDS\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'summary', 'skills', 'headline', 'experience.title', and 'experience.job_summary'\\n        - Note: Skills are matched in all titles and job summaries regardless of timeline\\n\\n        2. INDUSTRY\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.company_description', 'experience.company_industry', 'experience.company_speciality', 'experience.title', and 'experience.job_summary'\\n        - Timeline options:\\n          * Current: Matched where 'experience.end' is null\\n          * Past: Matched where 'experience.end' is not null\\n          * Current or Past: Ignores 'experience.end' and matches all\\n          * Current and Past: Matches where 'experience.end' is null AND where not null\\n\\n        3. COMPANY\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.company'\\n        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\\n\\n        4. LOCATION\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'location_full_path'\\n        - Timeline options apply when combined with other filters\\n\\n        5. JOB_TITLE/BUSINESS_FUNCTION\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.title'\\n        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\\n        - May include company size check on number of people at the company\\n\\n        6. MANAGEMENT_LEVEL\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.title'\\n        - Important note: For C-Suites, all titles that lie in C-Suites are matched. For Director, the substring \\\"Director\\\" is matched.\\n        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\\n\\n        7. EDUCATION/SCHOOL/DEGREE\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'education' array of objects\\n\\n        8. EXPERIENCE FILTERS (TENURE)\\n        - TOTAL_WORKING_YEARS: Matched against 'total_tenure' (expressed in days in backend)\\n        - COMPANY_TENURE: Calculated for current company where 'experience.end' is null\\n        - ROLE_TENURE: Calculated for current role where 'experience.end' is null\\n\\n        ## IMPORTANT FILTER RELATIONS\\n        \\n        1. Job Title and Management Level\\n           - Both are mapped to 'experience.title'\\n           - Their relation is AND\\n           - Example: If Job Title is 'Sales' and Management Level is 'Director', both substrings must be present in 'experience.title'\\n        \\n        2. Ternary Relations\\n           - The system uses this relation: (Industry OR Companies) AND Job Title AND Management Level AND Skills AND Location AND Experience\\n           - This determines how multiple filters interact with each other\\n\\n        The final output must strictly follow this filter structure:\\n        {\\n            \\\"job_title/business_function\\\": {\\n                \\\"current\\\": [{\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}],\\n                \\\"past\\\": [{\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}],\\n                \\\"both\\\": [{\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}],\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"  # Can only be \\\"CURRENT\\\", \\\"PAST\\\", \\\"CURRENT OR PAST\\\", \\\"CURRENT AND PAST\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"management_level\\\": {\\n                \\\"current\\\": [],\\n                \\\"past\\\": [],\\n                \\\"both\\\": [],\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"location\\\": {\\n                \\\"current\\\": [],\\n                \\\"past\\\": [],\\n                \\\"both\\\": [],\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"company\\\": {\\n                \\\"current_prompt\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n                \\\"past_prompt\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"education\\\": [{\\\"degree\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"major\\\": \\\"\\\"}],\\n            \\\"school\\\": [],\\n            \\\"current_ownership\\\": [],\\n            \\\"name\\\": [],\\n            \\\"ethnicity\\\": [],\\n            \\\"age\\\": [],\\n            \\\"total_working_years\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n            \\\"role_tenure\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n            \\\"company_tenure\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n            \\\"skills\\\": []\\n        }\\n\\n        Before providing the final JSON:\\n        1.

FILTER AWARENESS: Carefully consider existing filter values when analyzing the query\\n        4. INTENT UNDERSTANDING: Comprehend the main intent of the recruitment query\\n        \\n        Key principles for FEEDBACK incorporation:\\n        - Treat feedback as the highest priority guidance for your analysis\\n        - Explicitly connect each piece of feedback to specific atomic sub-problems\\n        - If feedback contradicts the original query, prioritize the feedback's direction\\n        - Use feedback to refine, modify, or completely change your understanding of requirements\\n        - For each atomic sub-problem, include SPECIFIC quotes from the feedback that are relevant\\n        \\n        Key principles for ATOMIC SUB-PROBLEM creation:\\n        - Each sub-problem must address EXACTLY ONE specific requirement or concept\\n        - If a potential sub-problem addresses multiple requirements, split it further\\n        - Test each sub-problem with the question: \\\"Does this solve exactly one thing?\\\"\\n        - Avoid compound requirements within a single sub-problem\\n        - Ensure each sub-problem has a singular, clear focus\\n        \\n        For each ATOMIC sub-problem, you must:\\n        1.

Only include relevant filters with valid values\\n        5. Ensure all values are logically consistent\\n        6. Consider feedback and existing filter values in your integration\\n\\n        ## FILTER SYSTEM REFERENCE GUIDE\\n        This comprehensive guide explains how filters are mapped to backend data:\\n\\n        1. SKILL/KEYWORDS\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'summary', 'skills', 'headline', 'experience.title', and 'experience.job_summary'\\n        - Note: Skills are matched in all titles and job summaries regardless of timeline\\n\\n        2. INDUSTRY\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.company_description', 'experience.company_industry', 'experience.company_speciality', 'experience.title', and 'experience.job_summary'\\n        - Timeline options:\\n          * Current: Matched where 'experience.end' is null\\n          * Past: Matched where 'experience.end' is not null\\n          * Current or Past: Ignores 'experience.end' and matches all\\n          * Current and Past: Matches where 'experience.end' is null AND where not null\\n\\n        3. COMPANY\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.company'\\n        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\\n\\n        4. LOCATION\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'location_full_path'\\n        - Timeline options apply when combined with other filters\\n\\n        5. JOB_TITLE/BUSINESS_FUNCTION\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.title'\\n        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\\n        - May include company size check on number of people at the company\\n\\n        6. MANAGEMENT_LEVEL\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.title'\\n        - Important note: For C-Suites, all titles that lie in C-Suites are matched. For Director, the substring \\\"Director\\\" is matched.\\n        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\\n\\n        7. EDUCATION/SCHOOL/DEGREE\\n        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'education' array of objects\\n\\n        8. EXPERIENCE FILTERS (TENURE)\\n        - TOTAL_WORKING_YEARS: Matched against 'total_tenure' (expressed in days in backend)\\n        - COMPANY_TENURE: Calculated for current company where 'experience.end' is null\\n        - ROLE_TENURE: Calculated for current role where 'experience.end' is null\\n\\n        ## IMPORTANT FILTER RELATIONS\\n        \\n        1. Job Title and Management Level\\n           - Both are mapped to 'experience.title'\\n           - Their relation is AND\\n           - Example: If Job Title is 'Sales' and Management Level is 'Director', both substrings must be present in 'experience.title'\\n        \\n        2. Ternary Relations\\n           - The system uses this relation: (Industry OR Companies) AND Job Title AND Management Level AND Skills AND Location AND Experience\\n           - This determines how multiple filters interact with each other\\n\\n        The final output must strictly follow this filter structure:\\n        {\\n            \\\"job_title/business_function\\\": {\\n                \\\"current\\\": [{\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}],\\n                \\\"past\\\": [{\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}],\\n                \\\"both\\\": [{\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}],\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"  # Can only be \\\"CURRENT\\\", \\\"PAST\\\", \\\"CURRENT OR PAST\\\", \\\"CURRENT AND PAST\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"management_level\\\": {\\n                \\\"current\\\": [],\\n                \\\"past\\\": [],\\n                \\\"both\\\": [],\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"location\\\": {\\n                \\\"current\\\": [],\\n                \\\"past\\\": [],\\n                \\\"both\\\": [],\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"company\\\": {\\n                \\\"current_prompt\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n                \\\"past_prompt\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n                \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n            },\\n            \\\"education\\\": [{\\\"degree\\\": \\\"\\\", \\\"major\\\": \\\"\\\"}],\\n            \\\"school\\\": [],\\n            \\\"current_ownership\\\": [],\\n            \\\"name\\\": [],\\n            \\\"ethnicity\\\": [],\\n            \\\"age\\\": [],\\n            \\\"total_working_years\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n            \\\"role_tenure\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n            \\\"company_tenure\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n            \\\"skills\\\": []\\n        }\\n\\n        Before providing the final JSON:\\n        1.

are the explicit vs implicit requirements?\\n        - Are there any temporal aspects to consider (current vs past)?\\n        - What are the logical dependencies between different filters?\\n        - Are there any potential conflicts to resolve?\\n        - How does the feedback influence this component?\\n        - How do existing filter values influence this component?\\n        - How will the backend data structure process these filters?\\n\\n        Remember the important filter relations:\\n        - Job Title and Management Level are both matched in 'experience.title' with an AND relation\\n        - The system uses this relation: (Industry OR Companies) AND Job Title AND Management Level AND Skills AND Location AND Experience\\n\\n        Show your complete reasoning process

    "\n",
    "        1. SKILL/KEYWORDS\n",
    "        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'summary', 'skills', 'headline', 'experience.title', and 'experience.job_summary'\n",
    "        - Note: Skills are matched in all titles and job summaries regardless of timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. INDUSTRY\n",
    "        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.company_description', 'experience.company_industry', 'experience.company_speciality', 'experience.title', and 'experience.job_summary'\n",
    "        - Timeline options:\n",
    "          * Current: Matched where 'experience.end' is null\n",
    "          * Past: Matched where 'experience.end' is not null\n",
    "          * Current or Past: Ignores 'experience.end' and matches all\n",
    "          * Current and Past: Matches where 'experience.end' is null AND where not null\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. COMPANY\n",
    "        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.company'\n",
    "        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\n",
    "\n",
    "        4. LOCATION\n",
    "        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'location_full_path'\n",
    "        - Timeline options apply when combined with other filters\n",
    "\n",
    "        5. JOB_TITLE/BUSINESS_FUNCTION\n",
    "        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.title'\n",
    "        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\n",
    "        - May include company size check on number of people at the company\n",
    "\n",
    "        6. MANAGEMENT_LEVEL\n",
    "        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'experience.title'\n",
    "        - Important note: For C-Suites, all titles that lie in C-Suites are matched. For Director, the substring \"Director\" is matched.\n",
    "        - Timeline options apply as with Industry\n",
    "\n",
    "        7. EDUCATION/SCHOOL/DEGREE\n",
    "        - Backend mapping: Matched in 'education' array of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "        8. EXPERIENCE FILTERS (TENURE)\n",
    "        - TOTAL_WORKING_YEARS: Matched against 'total_tenure' (expressed in days in backend)\n",
    "        - COMPANY_TENURE: Calculated for current company where 'experience.end' is null\n",
    "        - ROLE_TENURE: Calculated for current role where 'experience.end' is null\n",
    "\n",
    "        ## IMPORTANT FILTER RELATIONS\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. Job Title and Management Level\n",
    "           - Both are mapped to 'experience.title'\n",
    "           - Their relation is AND\n",
    "           - Example: If Job Title is 'Sales' and Management Level is 'Director', both substrings must be present in 'experience.title'\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. Ternary Relations\n",
    "           - The system uses this relation: (Industry OR Companies) AND Job Title AND Management Level AND Skills AND Location AND Experience\n",
