DETAILED ANALYSIS**\n\n- **Solution 1: Job Title**\n  - **Contextual Fit**: The primary focus is on identifying candidates with the specific job title \"Chief Marketing Officer\".\n  - **Explicit Requirements**: Set the job title to \"Chief Marketing Officer\" to ensure precision and avoid broader titles.\n  - **Implicit Requirements**: The title must imply a current role, as the goal is to find someone actively functioning as a CMO.\n  - **Temporal Aspect**: Focus on the \"current\" job title since the requirement is for candidates currently holding the position.\n  - **Logical Dependencies**: This filter must align with others like location and skills to ensure relevance.\n  - **Potential Conflicts**: Including broader titles could dilute results, hence not considered.\n  - **Feedback & Existing Values**: No feedback influenced this; existing values prioritize exact title matching.\n\n- **Solution 2: Experience in Scaling AI-driven SaaS**\n  - **Contextual Fit**: The focus is on identifying candidates with specific skills related to scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms.\n  - **Explicit Requirements**: Use keywords like \"scaling AI SaaS\", \"AI-driven platform growth\", and \"SaaS scaling\".\n  - **Implicit Requirements**: These skills should be current to ensure recent and relevant experience.\n  - **Temporal Aspect**: Prioritize \"current\" skills/keywords for relevance.\n  - **Logical Dependencies**: Must work with the job title filter to ensure candidates are both CMO and have relevant skills.\n  - **Potential Conflicts**: Broader keywords could include less relevant profiles.\n  - **Feedback & Existing Values**: System learnings informed the use of precise keywords; no feedback altered the approach.\n\n- **Solution 3: Location**\n  - **Contextual Fit**: Preference for candidates based in the U.S.\n  - **Explicit Requirements**: Set location to \"U.S.\" to ensure precision.\n  - **Implicit Requirements**: Candidates should be currently based in the U.S.; remote work flexibility is not a primary consideration.\n  - **Temporal Aspect**: Focus on \"current\" location.\n  - **Logical Dependencies**: This filter complements the job title and skills to narrow down the candidate pool effectively.\n  - **Potential Conflicts**: Restricting to the U.S. might exclude excellent candidates willing to relocate.\n  - **Feedback & Existing Values**: Existing filter values already align with U.S. preference; no feedback modified this choice.\n\n**2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER**\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: \n  - Set \"current\" to \"Chief Marketing Officer\" with a focus on precision to avoid broader titles.\n  - \"event\" set to \"CURRENT\" because the role needs to be actively held.\n  \n- **Skills**:\n  - Include keywords like \"scaling AI SaaS\", \"AI-driven platform growth\", \"SaaS scaling\" to capture relevant experience.\n  \n- **Location**:\n  - Set \"current\" to \"U.S.\" to match the preference for U.S.-based candidates.\n  - \"event\" set to \"CURRENT\" to ensure present-day location relevance.\n\n**3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS**\n\n- Assumption: Candidates must be currently engaged in roles and skills relevant to the query.\n- Implication: Narrower filters mean a more precise but possibly smaller candidate pool.\n\n**4. VALIDATION CHECKS**\n\n- Ensured all filters align with explicit requirements.\n- Verified logical consistency between filters to avoid conflicts.\n- Checked that each filter addresses both explicit and implicit elements of the query.\n\n**5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION**\n\n- Minimal feedback was provided; decisions were primarily guided by system learnings and existing filter values.\n\n**6. FINAL FILTER JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [{\"title_name\": \"Chief Marketing Officer\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [\"U.S.\"],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [\"scaling AI SaaS\", \"AI-driven platform growth\", \"SaaS scaling\"]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure effectively integrates the solutions while maintaining alignment with the original query requirements.",
