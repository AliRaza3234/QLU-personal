Here, we break down the solutions and integrate them into a cohesive filter structure:\n\n### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n**Solution 1: Location Filter**\n- **Original Context**: Candidates must be based in Germany.\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Set the location filter to Germany.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Not explicitly temporal, but the location can be combined with other temporal filters.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: The location filter operates independently but will be used in conjunction with other filters like job title and industry.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No feedback suggests any changes; hence the location remains strictly Germany.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: No prior values influence this component as it is newly established.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matched in 'location_full_path'.\n\n**Solution 2: Job Title Filter**\n- **Original Context**: Candidates should hold the title 'communications director'.\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Use 'communications director' for current or past roles.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Cover both current and past roles, allowing more comprehensive matching.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Job Title and Management Level both map to 'experience.title'.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No feedback necessitates changes; the simple title match suffices.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: No prior values exist; set explicitly for this scenario.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matched in 'experience.title'.\n\n**Solution 3: Industry Filter**\n- **Original Context**: Candidates from premium FMCG companies.\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Use 'premium FMCG' for both current and past industry experiences.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Both current and past experiences are required for comprehensive coverage.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Industry filter is part of the ternary relation (Industry OR Companies).\n- **Feedback Influence**: No feedback changes; comprehensive coverage is prioritized.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: No known prior values.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matched in 'experience.company_description', 'experience.company_industry'.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Location**: Directly set to \"Germany\" to ensure candidates are based there.\n- **Job Title**: Set to \"communications director\" for both current and past roles to encompass candidates with relevant experience.\n- **Industry**: Set to \"premium FMCG\" for both current and past experiences to ensure a wide range of relevant candidates.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- **Assumptions**: The industry term \"premium FMCG\" is recognized by the backend. The timeline options for job title and industry are properly configured.\n- **Implications**: Broader candidate pool due to temporal inclusion. Location strictly limits candidates to Germany.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensure all filters are recognized by the backend.\n- Verify temporal settings align with the backend structure.\n- Confirm logical consistency across filters, particularly in their interaction.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- No specific feedback was given, hence the solutions directly address the original query requirements.\n\n### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n\n- Each filter aligns with the backend data structure:\n  - **Location**: 'location_full_path'\n  - **Job Title**: 'experience.title'\n  - **Industry**: 'experience.company_description', 'experience.company_industry', etc.\n\n### 7. FINAL FILTER JSON\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [{\"title_name\": \"communications director\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [\"Germany\"],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [],\n    \"industry\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [\"premium FMCG\"],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure reflects the solutions' integration, aligning with the original query and ensuring logical consistency across all specified filters.",

        "reasoning_and_analysis": "## DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n### Solution 1: Job Title\n- **Filter Mapping**: The requirement to identify candidates with specific job titles, such as 'Site Manager' and 'Director', maps directly to the `job_title/business_function` filter. The selection of roles ensures alignment with the operational focus in the original query.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Explicitly requires roles of 'Site Manager' and 'Director'.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: The solution focuses on both current and past roles, aligning with the query's requirement for comprehensive experience.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Relates to management level if titles like 'Director' imply a management position.\n- **Conflict Resolution**: Ensures that only relevant management and operational roles are included.\n- **Feedback Influence**: N/A, as no specific feedback is provided.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Directly uses job titles as specified in the original query; no prior values to adjust.\n- **Backend Processing**: Mapped to `experience.title` for both current and past experiences.\n\n### Solution 2: Location\n- **Filter Mapping**: Ensures candidates are associated with US-based companies, mapped to the `location` filter.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Explicitly requires US-based companies.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Applies as a location filter but should ensure relevancy in both current and past contexts.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Interacts with company and industry filters to ensure the whole profile aligns geographically.\n- **Conflict Resolution**: Avoids overlap with non-US locations.\n- **Feedback Influence**: N/A, but expands the 'US' filter with synonyms to ensure no profiles are missed.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Expands upon an existing 'US' location filter, adding synonyms.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches `location_full_path`, ensuring that all synonyms are covered.\n\n### Solution 3: Revenue\n- **Filter Mapping**: Ensures companies generate more than $1 million in revenue.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Explicitly targets companies with revenue above $1 million.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: None specified, as revenue is generally a static company attribute.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Works independently but complements location and industry filters to ensure company relevance.\n- **Conflict Resolution**: Ensures clarity by sticking to a simple threshold.\n- **Feedback Influence**: N/A, but the solution directly meets the requirement.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Retains the `revenue` filter as previously defined.\n- **Backend Processing**: Interacts with backend data checking revenue attributes.\n\n### Solution 4: Industry\n- **Filter Mapping**: Targets the Petroleum industry filter.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Requires experience in the Petroleum industry.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Applies to both current and past experiences.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Complements job title and location filters to ensure complete profile alignment.\n- **Conflict Resolution**: Avoids inclusion of unrelated industries.\n- **Feedback Influence**: N/A, but ensures coverage of both current and past roles in industry.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Uses existing 'Petroleum' filter value.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches `experience.company_industry` and similar fields.\n\n### Solution 5: Operational Domain\n- **Filter Mapping**: Combines job titles and industry filters to match operational roles at extraction sites.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Focuses on operational roles within petroleum or related extraction industries.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Should reflect current roles due to operational focus but includes past for comprehensive match.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Combines with industry and revenue filters, ensuring a holistic view of candidate relevance.\n- **Conflict Resolution**: Ensures specific operational roles are included by combining job title and industry filters.\n- **Feedback Influence**: N/A, but emphasizes operational focus.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Enhances existing industry and job title filters with a focus on operational roles.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches both `experience.title` and `experience.company_industry`.\n\n## REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n1. **Job Title/Business Function**: Ensuring 'Site Manager' and 'Director' are captured, relevant to operational roles in extraction.\n2. **Location**: Expanded to include US and its synonyms to ensure no US-based profiles are missed.\n3. **Revenue**: Simple threshold over $1 million, directly meeting the requirement.\n4. **Industry**: Petroleum is the key focus, ensuring alignment with extraction industry roles.\n5. **Operational Domain**: Combines job titles and industries, emphasizing operational roles at extraction sites.\n\n## ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- Assumes that 'Site Manager' and 'Director' are sufficient to capture required roles.\n- Assumes US synonyms are comprehensive enough.\n- Assumes revenue threshold is non-negotiable.\n- Assumes Petroleum industry covers all relevant extraction site roles.\n- Assumes operational focus aligns with specified job titles and industries.\n\n## VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Confirmed all filter values align with backend data structures.\n- Ensured no conflicts between filters.\n- Validated temporal aspects where relevant.\n\n## FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- No specific feedback, but solutions ensure coverage of all query aspects.\n\n## FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n\n- All filters mapped to appropriate backend fields.\n\n##

The job title will be \"Associate Director Biostatistics\", and the management level should include \"Director\" since the title implies a management role.\n     - For \"Senior RWE Data Scientist\", the `JOB_TITLE` filter will be directly applied.\n   - **Temporal Aspect:** The job titles should apply to both current and past roles since candidates with relevant past experience might also be valuable.\n   - **Logical Dependencies:** There is an AND relationship between job title and management level.\n   - **Feedback Influence:** No feedback was provided, so the focus remains on meeting the precise requirements of the job titles.\n   - **Existing Filter Values:** The filters will be configured to capture exact job titles and management levels.\n\n2. **Industry:**\n   - **Requirement:** Candidates should have experience in the pharmaceutical industry.\n   - **Solution Mapping:** Use the `INDUSTRY` filter set to \"Pharmaceuticals\" with the timeline \"Current and Past\" to ensure comprehensive industry experience.\n   - **Temporal Aspect:** Use \"Current and Past\" to capture candidates with ongoing or past experience in the industry.\n   - **Feedback Influence:** None provided, so the focus is on broad inclusion of industry experience.\n   - **Existing Filter Values:** The filter should be set to capture all relevant industry experiences.\n\n3. **Location:**\n   - **Requirement:** Candidates must be located in the United States.\n   - **Solution Mapping:** Apply the `LOCATION` filter to include \"United States\".\n   - **Temporal Aspect:** Although location typically doesn't have a temporal aspect, it should apply to current profiles.\n   - **Feedback Influence:** None provided, so the solution is straightforward.\n   -

This involves understanding both explicit and implicit requirements, considering temporal aspects, logical dependencies, potential conflicts, feedback influence, and existing filter values.\n\n### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n#### Solution 1: Job Title and Management Level\n- **Mapped Filter**: `job_title/business_function` and `management_level`\n- **Requirements**: This solution focuses on candidates with the job title \"Chief Operating Officer\" (COO) and management level as \"C-Suite/Chiefs\".\n- **Temporal Considerations**: Both current and past roles are relevant to broaden the candidate pool.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: The job title and management level need to be aligned, ensuring candidates have held COO roles at the C-Suite level.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: This solution may exclude candidates who have equivalent roles under different titles.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback provided; assumptions are made about the importance of executive-level experience.\n- **Existing Filter Values**: The solution suggests using both job title and management level filters to ensure candidates are at the correct hierarchy level.\n\n#### Solution 2: Industry Experience\n- **Mapped Filter**: `industry`\n- **Requirements**: Candidates should have experience in the \"Clothing Retail\" or \"Apparel Retail\" industries.\n- **Temporal Considerations**: Both current and past experiences are included to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: The industry filter works in tandem with job title filters to refine candidate selection.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Broader retail sectors may inadvertently be included.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Despite no specific feedback, the approach aligns with general expectations for industry-specific expertise.\n- **Existing Filter Values**: The industry filter's flexibility in timeline settings ensures compatibility with other role and management level filters.\n\n#### Solution 3: Digital Commerce Expertise\n- **Mapped Filters**: `industry` and `company`\n- **Requirements**: Candidates should have experience in industries or companies known for digital commerce, such as \"E-commerce\", \"Retail\", \"Technology\", and specific companies like \"Amazon\", \"Nordstrom\", \"eBay\".\n- **Temporal Considerations**: Both current and past experiences are relevant.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: These filters complement each other, enhancing the focus on digital commerce expertise.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Broader industry focus might include candidates with less direct digital commerce experience.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Assumptions about the need for digital commerce expertise are made.\n- **Existing Filter Values**: The choice of filters aims to effectively capture digital commerce expertise.\n\n#### Solution 4: Similar Companies to Nordstrom\n- **Mapped Filter**: `company`\n- **Requirements**: Candidates should have worked at companies similar to Nordstrom.\n- **Temporal Considerations**: Both current and past companies are relevant.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: This filter depends on the backend's ability to match similar companies.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: May require backend support for prompt processing.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback; the approach centers around using the company prompt effectively.\n- **Existing Filter Values**: The solution leverages backend capabilities to dynamically identify similar companies.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: Set to target \"Chief Operating Officer\" both in current and past roles, ensuring a broad candidate pool.\n- **Management Level**: Filter candidates who are at the \"C-Suite/Chiefs\" level to maintain executive-level relevance.\n- **Industry**: Incorporate \"Clothing Retail\" and \"Apparel Retail\" to ensure candidates have relevant industry experience.\n- **Company**: Include a company prompt for \"Nordstrom and similar companies\" to dynamically find candidates with experience in comparable organizations.\n- **Digital Commerce**: Utilize both industry and company filters to capture candidates with digital commerce experience.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- We assume that equivalent executive roles may not explicitly include \"COO\" in the title, so broadening the search with similar titles may be beneficial.\n- The industry and company filters must effectively capture candidates with digital commerce expertise, despite potential overlaps with broader sectors.\n- The backend's ability to process company prompts accurately is critical for identifying similar companies.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensure that all filter values align with the backend data structure.\n- Validate that the temporal settings (current or past) are correctly applied.\n- Confirm that the combination of filters supports the intended search scope.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- While no direct feedback was provided, assumptions were made to align with typical role requirements for a COO and the importance of industry and digital commerce expertise.\n\n### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n\n- All filters have been mapped to their respective backend data structures, ensuring consistency with the reference guide.\n\n### 7. FINAL FILTER JSON\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [{\"title_name\": \"Chief Operating Officer\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}],\n        \"past\": [{\"title_name\": \"Chief Operating Officer\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [\"C-Suite/Chiefs\"],\n        \"past\": [\"C-Suite/Chiefs\"],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"Nordstrom and similar companies\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"Nordstrom and similar companies\",\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [],\n    \"industry\": {\n        \"current\": [\"Clothing Retail\", \"Apparel Retail\", \"E-commerce\", \"Retail\"],\n        \"past\": [\"Clothing Retail\", \"Apparel Retail\", \"E-commerce\", \"Retail\"],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure accurately reflects the integration of the four solutions, maintaining logical consistency and alignment with the backend data structure.",
