DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n**Solution 1: Strict Job Title Matching**\n\n- **Requirement:** Ensure candidates are or have been Chief Marketing Officers.\n- **Feedback:** Non-CMO candidates are appearing. Tighten the filter to exact matches.\n- **Integration:** Use exact job titles 'CMO' and 'Chief Marketing Officer' to refine current and past job roles.\n- **Logical Dependencies:** It aligns with the feedback to ensure only relevant candidates are selected. No temporal ambiguity as it applies to both current and past roles.\n\n**Solution 2: Geographic Scope Expansion**\n\n- **Requirement:** Broaden the search to include candidates from outside the U.S.\n- **Feedback:** Results overly concentrated in the U.S.\n- **Integration:** Extend the location filter to include 'Canada', 'United Kingdom', 'Germany', and 'India'.\n- **Logical Dependencies:** Slightly expands geographical scope while maintaining a focus on relevant markets.\n\n**Solution 3: Experience in Scaling AI-driven SaaS Platforms**\n\n- **Requirement:** Identify candidates with experience in scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms.\n- **Feedback:** Focus on experience rather than location or title.\n- **Integration:** Add skills like 'scaling SaaS platforms', 'AI-driven product growth', and 'AI SaaS scaling expertise'.\n- **Logical Dependencies:** Enhances specificity in skill requirements, aligns with industry filters to ensure relevance.\n\n**Solution 4: Past Sales Experience**\n\n- **Requirement:** Identify candidates with past experience in sales.\n- **Feedback:** Emphasizes need for past sales roles.\n- **Integration:** Add 'Sales Manager', 'Sales Executive', 'Sales Director' to past job titles.\n- **Logical Dependencies:** Focuses on past roles to ensure candidates have relevant sales experience.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function:**\n  - **Current:** Use exact titles 'CMO' and 'Chief Marketing Officer'.\n  - **Past:** Include 'Sales Manager', 'Sales Executive', 'Sales Director'.\n  - **Event:** 'CURRENT AND PAST' to ensure candidates meet both CMO and sales criteria.\n- **Location:**\n  - **Current:** ['United States', 'Canada', 'United Kingdom', 'Germany', 'India'].\n  - **Event:** 'CURRENT' to ensure current location relevance.\n- **Skills:**\n  - **Current or Past:** ['scaling SaaS platforms', 'AI-driven product growth', 'AI SaaS scaling expertise'].\n- **Industry:**\n  - **Current:** ['Enterprise SaaS/Software', 'Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Companies'].\n- **Experience:**\n  - **Total Working Years:** Maintain existing constraints, 'min': 5, 'max': 100.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- **Assumptions:** Candidates with past sales roles have relevant sales experience. Geographical expansion doesn't dilute candidate quality.\n- **Implications:** Strict job title matching may exclude similar roles; additional locations may increase candidate pool but maintain quality.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- **Checks:** Ensure job title filters are strict, location filter balances U.S. dominance, skills are relevant to scaling SaaS, and past sales role inclusion is precise.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- **Feedback:** Addressed CMO exclusivity, expanded geographic range, and ensured past sales experience integration.\n\n### 6.
