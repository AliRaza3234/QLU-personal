The solution proposes modifying the existing filter from \"Sales Executive\" to \"Senior Sales Executive,\" ensuring alignment with the feedback that emphasized seniority.\n\n   **Solution 2:** Introduces a management level filter to identify senior management positions, such as \"Director,\" \"Vice President,\" and \"Senior Vice President.\" This solution acknowledges the absence of a management level filter in the existing values and addresses the need to highlight senior positions.\n\n2. **REASONING FOR EACH FILTER**\n\n   - **Job Title/Business Function:**\n     - From Solution 1, we adopt \"Senior Sales Executive\" as the refined title, directly addressing the feedback requirement for seniority.\n     - The existing \"Sales Executive\" entry is replaced by \"Senior Sales Executive,\" aligning with the feedback to focus on senior roles.\n\n   - **Management Level:**\n     - Solution 2 introduces \"Director,\" \"Vice President,\" and \"Senior Vice President\" under management levels. This addition is crucial as it directly highlights senior management roles, which are inherently aligned with the requirement for senior sales executives.\n\n3. **ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS**\n\n   - The solutions assume that the terms \"Senior Sales Executive\" and management titles like \"Director\" or \"Vice President\" are universally recognized as senior roles.\n   - It is assumed that refining the job title and adding management levels will sufficiently capture the seniority aspect required by the feedback.\n\n4. **VALIDATION CHECKS**\n\n   - Ensure that \"Senior Sales Executive\" is commonly accepted across different organizations as a senior role.\n   - Validate that the management levels (\"Director,\" \"Vice President,\" \"Senior Vice President\") are recognized as senior positions across various industries.\n\n5. **FEEDBACK INCORPORATION**\n\n   - Feedback explicitly required focusing on senior sales executives. Both solutions address this by refining the job title and introducing a management level filter, ensuring the focus is narrowed to senior roles.\n\n6. **EXISTING FILTER VALUES INTEGRATION**\n\n   - The existing filter values already included \"Sales Executive.\" This was refined to \"Senior Sales Executive\" to align with the feedback, ensuring continuity and specificity.\n   - The absence of a management level filter allowed for a seamless addition of senior titles, enhancing the specificity of the search.\n\n7. **FINAL FILTER JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [\n            {\n                \"title_name\": \"Senior Sales Executive\",\n                \"min_staff\": 0,\n                \"max_staff\": 50000000\n            }\n        ],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [\"Director\", \"Vice President\", \"Senior Vice President\"],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null\n    },\n    \"role_tenure\": {\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null\n    },\n    \"company_tenure\": {\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null\n    },\n    \"skills\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure reflects the integration of both solutions, refining the job title to include \"Senior Sales Executive\" and adding specific management levels to ensure the focus is on senior roles, as required by the feedback.",
