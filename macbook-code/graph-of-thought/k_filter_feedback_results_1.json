DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\nThe task involves integrating four solutions into a cohesive filter structure to accurately find a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) with experience in scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms, preferably based in the U.S. Let's analyze each solution:\n\n1. **Job Title/Business Function:**\n   - The primary requirement is to find candidates with the exact job title of \"Chief Marketing Officer\" (CMO). This aligns with the feedback to focus on literal job titles to avoid broadening the search.\n\n2. **Skills/Keywords:**\n   - The focus is on candidates with experience in scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms. Keywords such as \"scaling,\" \"AI-driven SaaS,\" and \"platform growth\" are crucial for identifying relevant experience.\n\n3. **Industry:**\n   - The need to recognize \"AI-driven SaaS platforms\" as a specific industry ensures that candidates' experience aligns with the niche market.\n\n4. **Location:**\n   - Preference is given to candidates based in the U.S., which needs to be explicitly set in the location filter to ensure precision and alignment with the feedback.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function:**\n  - **Event:** \"CURRENT\" is the appropriate choice as the requirement is for the current role of CMO.\n  - **Filter Value:** Set to \"Chief Marketing Officer\" with min_staff and max_staff as default values (0 and 50000000) because the number of staff is not specified in the requirements.\n\n- **Skills:**\n  - **Filter Values:** Include keywords like \"scaling,\" \"AI-driven SaaS,\" and \"platform growth\" to capture candidates with the required experience.\n\n- **Industry:**\n  - **Filter Value:** \"AI-driven SaaS platforms\" should be treated as a single industry entry to maintain the integrity of the search.\n\n- **Location:**\n  - **Event:** \"CURRENT\" is appropriate as the location preference is for the current residence in the U.S.\n  - **Filter Value:** Set to \"U.S.\" to ensure candidates are currently based there.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- **Exact Job Title:** By focusing on the exact job title \"Chief Marketing Officer,\" we assume this will exclude similar roles like \"VP of Marketing,\" potentially narrowing down the candidate pool.\n- **Skill Keywords:** Relying on specific keywords assumes candidates have explicitly listed these experiences, which might not be the case for all qualified candidates.\n- **Industry Specificity:** Assuming the search engine can recognize \"AI-driven SaaS platforms\" as a single industry term.\n- **Location Preference:** Assumes candidates currently based in the U.S. are preferred over those willing to relocate.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensured that the job title is explicitly set and does not broaden to similar titles.\n- Checked that the skills filter explicitly includes relevant keywords.\n- Validated that the industry term is cohesive and specific.\n- Confirmed the location filter is precisely set to the U.S.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- Feedback about focusing on the exact job title has been directly addressed.\n- Emphasized clarity and precision in location preference as per feedback.\n- Integrated system learnings about maintaining a cohesive industry term and emphasizing action verbs in skills.\n\n### 6. FINAL FILTER JSON\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [{\"title_name\": \"Chief Marketing Officer\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [\"U.S.\"],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [{\"degree\": \"\", \"major\": \"\"}],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [\"scaling\", \"AI-driven SaaS\", \"platform growth\"]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON effectively integrates all solutions, ensuring alignment with the original query while adhering to feedback and system learnings.",
