DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n**Original Query:** Looking for a Germany-based communications director who comes from premium FMCG companies.\n\nWe'll break down the solutions into key components and map them to our filter structure:\n\n#### Solution 1: **Location**\n- **Focus:** Germany\n- **Explicit Requirement:** Candidates currently based in Germany.\n- **Implicit Requirements:** Ensure precise filtering for location.\n- **Temporal Aspect:** Primarily interested in the current location.\n- **Filter Mapping:** Maps to the `location` filter with \"current\" event.\n- **Feedback Influence:** No specific feedback, so the focus is on precise implementation.\n- **Existing Filter Values:** Germany is already configured, no change needed.\n\n#### Solution 2: **Job Title**\n- **Focus:** Communications Director\n- **Explicit Requirement:** Candidates who have held or currently hold the title.\n- **Implicit Requirements:** Include both current and past roles.\n- **Temporal Aspect:** Use \"Current or Past\" for inclusivity.\n- **Filter Mapping:** Maps to `job_title/business_function` with \"both\" event.\n- **Feedback Influence:** None; focus on maintaining existing values.\n- **Existing Filter Values:** Align with current filter structure.\n\n#### Solution 3: **Industry and Company**\n- **Focus:** Premium FMCG\n- **Explicit Requirement:** Experience in premium FMCG companies.\n- **Implicit Requirements:** Utilize both industry and company filters for precision.\n- **Temporal Aspect:** Current or past experience acceptable.\n- **Filter Mapping:** Maps to `industry` and `company`.\n- **Logical Dependencies:** Industry and company should work together to ensure only premium FMCG experiences.\n- **Feedback Influence:** None; accuracy in capturing premium experiences is prioritized.\n- **Existing Filter Values:** Use existing industry value and enhance with specific companies.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n#### Location\n- **Reasoning:** The original context specifies a Germany-based candidate. The best approach is to ensure the filter precisely matches candidates currently located in Germany.\n- **Timeline:** \"Current\" is appropriate since the location needs to reflect where the candidate is now.\n\n#### Job Title\n- **Reasoning:** \"Communications Director\" is the specific title required. Including both current and past titles ensures a wider pool of candidates.\n- **Timeline:** \"Both\" covers all relevant candidates who have had the role at any time.\n\n#### Industry and Company\n- **Reasoning:** Candidates must have experience in premium FMCG companies. A combination of industry and company filters ensures precise targeting.\n- **Timeline:** \"Current or Past\" ensures all relevant experiences are included.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- We assume that the location data is accurate and that candidates are tagged correctly in the backend.\n- For the job title, we assume that \"Communications Director\" captures all relevant role designations.\n- Premium FMCG is assumed to be a distinct segment that can be clearly differentiated from non-premium FMCG.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- **Location:** Ensure \"Germany\" is correctly represented in `location_full_path`.\n- **Job Title:** Confirm that \"Communications Director\" is matched in `experience.title`.\n- **Industry and Company:** Verify that \"Premium FMCG\" and specific companies are accurately tagged.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- No specific feedback was provided. The focus remains on implementing the filters accurately.\n\n### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n\n- **Location:** `location_full_path` in the backend correctly maps to Germany.\n- **Job Title:** `experience.title` matches \"Communications Director.\"\n- **Industry and Company:** `experience.company_industry` and `experience.company` will be used to filter premium FMCG experiences.\n\n### 7. FINAL FILTER JSON\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [{\"title_name\": \"Communications Director\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [\"Germany\"],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"Top premium FMCG companies\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"Top premium FMCG companies\",\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [],\n    \"industry\": {\n        \"current\": [\"Premium FMCG\"],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure aligns with the backend data structure and ensures all specified requirements are met comprehensively and accurately.",

DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n#### Solution 1: Site Manager Role\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: This solution emphasizes the 'Site Manager' role across current and past experiences. It maps to the `job_title/business_function` filter with \"Current and Past\" as the timeline.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Identify candidates with experience as a 'Site Manager'.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Includes both current and past roles for comprehensive coverage.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: This job title must coexist with the 'Director' role and relevant operational roles.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Broad coverage might include outdated experience.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback, so the focus is on capturing all relevant experience.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Ensures compatibility with other roles requiring operational expertise.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches in 'experience.title' for both current and past experiences.\n\n#### Solution 2: Director Role\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: The 'Director' title is included under `job_title/business_function` with \"Current or Past\" timeline.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Ensure 'Director' is present in job titles.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Covers both current and past experiences.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Must be combined with 'Site Manager' in an AND relation.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None identified; aligns well with other titles.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Direct focus on 'Director' without additional constraints.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Supports the requirement for management roles.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches 'experience.title' across all experiences.\n\n#### Solution 3: US-based Companies\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Uses the `location` filter set to \"United States\" for both current and past experiences.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Ensure companies are US-based.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Matches any experience linked to US-based companies.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Must align with other filters to ensure company relevance.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None; straightforward geographic constraint.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No feedback; simple geographic specification.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Aligns with company location requirements.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches 'location_full_path' for US-based companies.\n\n#### Solution 4: Revenue Over 1 Million Dollars\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Uses a creative interpretation of the `company` filter with a prompt specifying revenue.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Companies must generate over 1 million dollars.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Assumes relevance for current and past companies.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Works in conjunction with US-based companies.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Backend capability to interpret revenue prompts.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No direct feedback; relies on backend interpretation.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Utilizes existing company metadata as a proxy.\n- **Backend Processing**: Relies on backend's ability to interpret prompts related to company revenue.\n\n#### Solution 5: Operational Domain\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Uses `job_title/business_function` to capture roles like 'Site Manager', 'Operations Director', and 'Extraction Supervisor'.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Focus on operational functions at extraction sites.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Includes roles across all timelines for comprehensive coverage.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Interacts with industry and skills for complete domain specification.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Ensures roles are correctly identified as operational.\n- **Feedback Influence**: None; directly implements the operational role requirement.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Complements roles in extraction and operations.\n- **Backend Processing**: Matches titles related to operational functions.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: Must include 'Site Manager', 'Director', and operational roles like 'Operations Director', matching both current and past experiences.\n- **Management Level**: 'Director' role must be present, ensuring the role's management level is captured.\n- **Location**: Must be set to \"United States\" to ensure US-based company association.\n- **Company**: Needs a prompt to identify companies generating over 1 million dollars.\n- **Skills/Industry**: While not explicitly mentioned, operational roles imply relevant skills and industries should be inferred.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n- Assumed backend can interpret company prompts related to revenue.\n- Assumed 'Director' involves management level responsibilities.\n- Implicitly, roles are in petroleum or similar industries due to the context.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n- Ensure all job titles have an AND relation with management levels.\n- Validate geographic and revenue constraints are properly interpreted.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n- Feedback was minimal; focus was on complete and accurate translation of requirements.\n\n### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n- Verified all filters align with backend data structure and requirements.\n\n### 7.

Director Biostatistics\".\n  - Current position as \"Senior RWE Data Scientist\".\n  \n- **Industry**: \n  - Experience in the pharmaceutical industry, considering both current and past experiences.\n  \n- **Location**: \n  - Current residence in the United States.\n\n### Temporal Aspects\n- Job Titles need to be current.\n- Industry experience can be current or past to ensure a wide net is cast on candidates with relevant backgrounds.\n\n### Logical Dependencies\n- The job title and management level must both be matched in the `experience.title`.\n- The filter structure follows: (Industry OR Companies) AND Job Title AND Management Level AND Skills AND Location AND Experience.\n\n### Potential Conflicts\n- Different job titles might require careful structuring to ensure both are considered without excluding candidates based on variant naming.\n- Ensuring candidates with past but not current roles in the pharmaceutical industry are still considered without compromising relevance.\n\n### Feedback Influence\n- No direct feedback was provided, so alignment with system guidelines and logical consistency is prioritized.\n\n### Existing Filter Values Influence\n- Existing values guide the incorporation of timeline options and job title variants, especially ensuring that title variants are included.\n\n### Backend Processing\n- Filters must match the backend data structure accurately, ensuring correct fields are targeted (e.g., `experience.title`, `experience.company_industry`, `location_full_path`).\n\n## 2.

Director Biostatistics\", as well as \"Senior RWE Data Scientist\", given the current nature of these job titles.\n- **Event**: \"CURRENT\", since the role must be held currently.\n\n### Industry\n- **Both**: Use \"pharmaceutical\" with \"Current or Past\" setting to capture candidates with relevant experience at any point.\n\n### Location\n- **Both**: \"United States\" with a focus on validating the location to ensure it matches profiles with `location_full_path` containing \"United States\".\n- **Event**: \"CURRENT OR PAST\", to ensure it captures currently residing candidates.\n\n## 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- Assuming that job titles and management levels are captured accurately in the `experience.title` field.\n- Implicitly assumes that candidates with past pharmaceutical experience are still relevant.\n\n## 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensure that titles are set to \"CURRENT\" and industry to \"Current or Past\" to maximize relevancy.\n- Validate that `location_full_path` matches candidates within the United States.\n\n## 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- No feedback was provided, focusing on accurate implementation and validation according to guidelines.\n\n## 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n\n- Verify that each filter aligns with the backend data structure mappings, ensuring precise targeting.\n\n## 7.

Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown of how each solution component fits into the final filter structure, along with the necessary reasoning and considerations:\n\n### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\n**Solution 1: Job Title Filter**\n- **Mapped Filter**: `job_title/business_function`\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Identify candidates with the title \"Chief Operating Officer\".\n- **Implicit Requirement**: Include variations such as \"COO\" to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Consider both current and past experiences to widen the candidate pool.\n- **Logical Dependency**: Integrates with Management Level for title specificity.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None, as COO is a specific title.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback was provided, maintaining focus on title precision.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Enhances specificity for the COO role.\n\n**Solution 2: Industry Filter**\n- **Mapped Filter**: `industry`\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Target the clothing retail industry.\n- **Implicit Requirement**: Consider related sectors like \"Fashion Retail\" and \"Apparel Retail\".\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Consider both current and past industry experiences.\n- **Logical Dependency**: Industry filter interacts with Company filter for company-industry match.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Broader industry inclusion might lead to irrelevant profiles.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No direct feedback, but focus remains on industry specificity.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Aligns with existing industry-related filters.\n\n**Solution 3: Digital Commerce Skills**\n- **Mapped Filter**: `skills`\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Include skills related to digital commerce.\n- **Implicit Requirement**: Ensure skills like \"e-commerce\" and \"digital marketing\" are included.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Skills are timeless and do not have a temporal aspect.\n- **Logical Dependency**: Skills filter complements industry and company filters for digital emphasis.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None, as skills are additive to the filter criteria.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Utilizes general understanding of digital commerce priorities.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Augments existing skills filters with a focus on digital commerce.\n\n**Solution 4: Company Filter**\n- **Mapped Filter**: `company`\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Include companies similar to Nordstrom.\n- **Implicit Requirement**: Focus on companies with strong digital commerce presence.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: Consider current or past company affiliations.\n- **Logical Dependency**: Company filter interacts with Industry for relevance.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None, as the focus is on similar business models.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback; focus remains on precise company identification.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Complements existing company-related filters.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: Ensures candidates have held the COO position, capturing both current and past roles.\n- **Industry**: Targets clothing retail, ensuring relevance to the query.\n- **Skills**: Focuses on digital commerce skills, critical for a retailer with an online presence.\n- **Company**: Targets companies like Nordstrom, likely to have similar operational models.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n- Assumed the primary focus is on candidates with direct experience in the specified roles and industries.\n- Implicitly targeting candidates with both industry and digital commerce expertise due to the nature of the query.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n- Ensured all filters are logically consistent and aligned with backend mapping.\n- Confirmed timeline consideration for each relevant filter.\n\n### 5.
