        "reasoning_and_analysis": "### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n- **Solution 1: Location Filter**\n  - **Mapping to Filter Structure**: This solution maps directly to the \"LOCATION\" filter.\n  - **Explicit Requirements**: Candidates must be located in Germany.\n  - **Implicit Requirements**: Must consider candidates who specify \"Germany\" specifically in their location data.\n  - **Temporal Aspects**: Since location isn't inherently temporal, the \"both\" field in the location timeline will be used to cover candidates regardless of timeline.\n  - **Logical Dependencies**: None, as location is standalone in this context.\n  - **Potential Conflicts**: None identified; the location is straightforward.\n  - **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback; focus remains on precision.\n  - **Existing Filter Values Influence**: Ensure consistency with other filters like industry and job title.\n  - **Backend Processing**: The backend should match profiles where 'location_full_path' includes 'Germany'.\n\n- **Solution 2: Job Title Filter**\n  - **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Maps to \"JOB_TITLE/BUSINESS_FUNCTION\".\n  - **Explicit Requirements**: Candidates must have the title \"Communications Director\".\n  - **Implicit Requirements**: The title should be matched precisely in their experience.\n  - **Temporal Aspects**: Use the \"both\" field to cover \"Current or Past\" roles to include all relevant experiences.\n  - **Logical Dependencies**: Must align with management level if specified in the future.\n  - **Potential Conflicts**: None identified; the title is specific.\n  - **Feedback Influence**: No feedback provided; focus on comprehensive coverage.\n  - **Existing Filter Values Influence**: Aligns with other filters like industry.\n  - **Backend Processing**: The backend should match 'experience.title' for \"Communications Director\".\n\n- **Solution 3: Industry and Company Filter**\n  - **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Maps to \"INDUSTRY\" and \"COMPANY\".\n  - **Explicit Requirements**: Candidates with experience in \"FMCG\" and from specific premium companies.\n  - **Implicit Requirements**: Companies should be recognized as premium in the FMCG sector.\n  - **Temporal Aspects**: Use \"Current or Past\" to ensure candidates' experiences are relevant.\n  - **Logical Dependencies**: Must work with job title and location filters.\n  - **Potential Conflicts**: Avoid overlapping or redundant company names.\n  - **Feedback Influence**: No feedback integrated, focus on logical expansion.\n  - **Existing Filter Values Influence**: Aligns with location and job title for a comprehensive search.\n  - **Backend Processing**: The backend should match 'experience.company' and 'experience.company_industry' for the specified companies and industry.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Location**: Set to \"Germany\" to match candidates based there.\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: Set to \"Communications Director\" with \"Current or Past\" to capture full range of experience.\n- **Industry**: Set to \"FMCG\" to cover the entire sector.\n- **Company**: List specific premium FMCG companies for precise targeting.\n- **Temporal Fields**: Use \"both\" in timelines to cover all relevant experiences.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- Assumed that candidates must be physically based in Germany, not just remotely working for a German company.\n- Assumed that the job title \"Communications Director\" is the primary role of interest, with no management level specified.\n- Assumed that premium FMCG companies are well-known and listed correctly.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensure filters match backend data fields correctly.\n- Validate that timeline fields cover current or past roles as needed.\n- Confirm company names are correctly spelled and recognized as premium.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- No specific feedback was available, so focus remains on precise and logical filter application.\n\n### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n\n- Cross-checked filter mappings with backend data references to ensure alignment.\n\n### 7. FINAL FILTER JSON\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [{\n            \"title_name\": \"Communications Director\",\n            \"min_staff\": 0,\n            \"max_staff\": 50000000\n        }],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [\"Germany\"],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\",\n        \"name\": [\n            \"Procter & Gamble\", \"Unilever\", \"Nestle\", \n            \"L'Oreal\", \"Coca-Cola\", \"Diageo\", \n            \"PepsiCo\", \"Mondelez International\", \"Reckitt Benckiser\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [],\n    \"industry\": [\"FMCG\"]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure reflects the integration of all solutions, ensures alignment with backend data, and logically combines filters to meet the original query's requirements.",

DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n#### **Solution 1: Site Manager Title Filter**\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: The 'Site Manager' title is mapped to the `job_title/business_function` filter.\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit Requirements**:\n  - **Explicit**: The necessity to find candidates with the specific title 'Site Manager'.\n  - **Implicit**: The title must be present in either current or past experiences, and align with operational roles.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Both current and past roles should be considered for comprehensive coverage.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Must align with the Management Level filter as 'Director' is also a requirement.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None, as 'Site Manager' is a specific title.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Focuses on precision without feedback adjustments.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: No existing values affect this solution.\n- **Backend Processing**: Maps to `experience.title`.\n\n#### **Solution 2: Director Title Filter**\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: This is also under `job_title/business_function`.\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit Requirements**:\n  - **Explicit**: Candidates must have held or currently hold a 'Director' position.\n  - **Implicit**: Ensures leadership experience aligned with management roles.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Focus is on current roles to align with real-time leadership needs.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Must work with the 'Site Manager' requirement.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Ensures no conflict by focusing on current roles.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No feedback adjustments.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Aligns with 'Site Manager'.\n- **Backend Processing**: Maps to `experience.title`.\n\n#### **Solution 3: US Location Filter**\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Mapped to the `location` filter.\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit Requirements**:\n  - **Explicit**: The company must be US-based.\n  - **Implicit**: Aligns with the context of the operation being in a known industry hub.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Not applicable as location is static.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Works with the COMPANY filter to ensure the company's location is in the US.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No adjustments needed.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Standalone as a geographic criterion.\n- **Backend Processing**: Maps to `location_full_path`.\n\n#### **Solution 4: High Revenue Company Filter**\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Mapped to `company` filter with an implicit understanding of high revenue.\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit Requirements**:\n  - **Explicit**: Companies must generate over 1 million dollars.\n  - **Implicit**: Using Fortune 500 or similar large entities as a proxy for revenue.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Not applicable.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Works with LOCATION to ensure US-based.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: Potential exclusion of non-Fortune 500 companies that meet revenue criteria.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Not directly impacted by feedback.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Complements the US location requirement.\n- **Backend Processing**: Indirectly inferred through company attributes.\n\n#### **Solution 5: Operational Domain Expertise**\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Mapped to `skills` and `industry` filters.\n- **Explicit vs. Implicit Requirements**:\n  - **Explicit**: Candidates must have operational skills.\n  - **Implicit**: Aligns with extraction site operations.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Relevant across all experiences.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Works with JOB_TITLE to ensure role-specific expertise.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None, as skills are broad.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No feedback, aligns with requirements.\n- **Existing Filter Influence**: Complements other filters for comprehensive expertise targeting.\n- **Backend Processing**: Maps to `summary`, `skills`, `headline`, and `experience`.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: \n  - `current`: Includes 'Director' to ensure current leadership roles.\n  - `past`: Includes 'Site Manager' to capture past relevant roles.\n  - `both`: None, as 'Site Manager' isn't required to be current.\n  - **Event**: \"CURRENT OR PAST\" to ensure either role at any time.\n  \n- **Management Level**: \n  - Focus on 'Director' in current roles to ensure alignment with leadership needs.\n  - **Event**: \"CURRENT\", ensuring focus on current capabilities.\n  \n- **Location**: \n  - Set to 'United States' ensuring companies are US-based.\n  - **Event**: Not applicable as location is not temporal.\n  \n- **Company**: \n  - Using 'Fortune 500' as a proxy for high revenue.\n  - **Event**: Not applicable as company status is static.\n  \n- **Skills**: \n  - Includes skills like 'extraction operations', 'site management', 'drilling operations'.\n  \n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- Assumption that specific job titles accurately represent required roles.\n- Implicit assumption that Fortune 500 status correlates with revenue expectations.\n- Assumes skills listed directly relate to operational roles.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensured all mappings align with backend structure.\n- Checked logical consistency between filters.\n- No conflicting requirements detected.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- No specific feedback adjustments were necessary as provided data was comprehensive.\n\n### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n\n- Verified against backend data structure to ensure correct attribute mapping.\n\n### 7.

        "reasoning_and_analysis": "To integrate the provided solutions into the final filter structure, I will go through each solution, analyze its components, consider explicit and implicit requirements, and determine how they fit within the filter structure. I will also address temporal aspects, logical dependencies, potential conflicts, and any influences from feedback or existing filter values. Let's start with a detailed analysis of each solution.\n\n### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n#### Solution 1: Associate Director Biostatistics\n- **Job Title**: The requirement is to find candidates with the title \"Associate Director Biostatistics\". This maps to the `job_title/business_function` filter with a focus on the exact title. The timeline \"current or past\" is applied to ensure candidates who have held or are holding the role are included.\n- **Industry**: The focus on the pharmaceutical industry is crucial. The `INDUSTRY` filter needs to include \"Pharmaceuticals\" with a timeline of \"current or past\" to capture all relevant experience.\n- **Interaction**: The interaction between Job Title and Industry ensures candidates have the right role and are from the relevant sector.\n- **Feedback**: No specific feedback was provided, maintaining the focus on role and industry alignment.\n\n#### Solution 2: Senior RWE Data Scientist\n- **Job Title**: The job title \"Senior RWE Data Scientist\" is directly mapped to the `job_title/business_function` filter. The emphasis is on precision, using the same timeline \"current or past\".\n- **Feedback**: The solution aims for accuracy without additional feedback adjustments.\n\n#### Solution 3: Pharmaceutical Background\n- **Industry**: The requirement is to ensure candidates have experience in the pharmaceutical industry. The `INDUSTRY` filter is set to \"Pharmaceuticals\" with \"current or past\" to cover all relevant candidates.\n- **Feedback**: No specific feedback, focusing on a comprehensive inclusion using the timeline.\n\n#### Solution 4: United States Location\n- **Location**: Candidates must be located in the United States, mapped to the `LOCATION` filter. This is a straightforward filter without timeline considerations.\n- **Feedback**: The solution remains straightforward with no feedback adjustments.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**:\n  - \"Associate Director Biostatistics\" and \"Senior RWE Data Scientist\" are set with \"current or past\" to include all relevant candidates.\n  - This ensures alignment with specific roles as outlined in the query.\n\n- **Industry**:\n  - \"Pharmaceuticals\" with \"current or past\" captures candidates with relevant industry experience.\n  - The emphasis is on ensuring domain-specific expertise.\n\n- **Location**:\n  - \"United States\" is applied to ensure geographic alignment with the query.\n  - There is no temporal aspect as location does not typically change with time in this context.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- The solutions assume candidates with past roles are as relevant as those currently holding them.\n- The industry filter assumes that any experience in Pharmaceuticals is relevant, regardless of the current employment sector.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensure that job titles are correctly matched in `experience.title`.\n- Verify that the industry and location filters are accurately applied to include all candidates with specified experience and geographic location.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- No specific feedback was provided, so the solutions are implemented based on the original query requirements, focusing on precision and relevance.\n\n### 6. FILTER MAPPING VERIFICATION\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: Matches `experience.title` with \"current or past\" timeline.\n- **Industry**: Matches `experience.company_industry` with \"current or past\".\n- **Location**: Matches `location_full_path`.\n\n### 7. FINAL FILTER JSON\n\nHere's the final JSON structure based on the above analysis and integration:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [\n            {\"title_name\": \"Associate Director Biostatistics\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Senior RWE Data Scientist\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}\n        ],\n        \"past\": [\n            {\"title_name\": \"Associate Director Biostatistics\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Senior RWE Data Scientist\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}\n        ],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [{\"full_path\": \"United States\"}],\n        \"past\": [{\"full_path\": \"United States\"}],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [],\n    \"industry\": {\n        \"current\": [{\"industry_name\": \"Pharmaceuticals\"}],\n        \"past\": [{\"industry_name\": \"Pharmaceuticals\"}],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure reflects the integration of the solutions, ensuring alignment with the original query and maintaining logical consistency across filters.",
