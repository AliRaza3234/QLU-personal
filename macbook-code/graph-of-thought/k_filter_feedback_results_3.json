The system emphasizes literal interpretation to avoid broader titles.\n   \n   - **Skills**: This involves identifying candidates with experience in scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms. Skills or keywords must reflect this experience explicitly.\n   \n   - **Company Tenure**: Ensure a minimum tenure to establish a strong track record, with 3+ years being a common benchmark for relevant experience.\n   \n   - **Location**: Candidates should be based in the U.S. The existing filter indicates broad U.S. coverage is preferred to ensure inclusivity.\n\n2. **REASONING FOR EACH FILTER**\n\n   - **Job Title/Business Function**: Set to \"Chief Marketing Officer\" to ensure precise matching. This avoids broader titles and directly aligns with the requirement.\n   \n   - **Skills**: Use \"scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms\" as a keyword to highlight specific expertise. This ensures candidates have relevant experience.\n   \n   - **Company Tenure**: Set a minimum of 3 years to ensure candidates have a proven track record in positions relevant to scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms.\n   \n   - **Location**: Use \"U.S.\" to maximize the pool of candidates while fulfilling the geographical preference.\n\n3. **ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS**\n\n   - Assumed that the role requires current experience, hence focus is on \"current\" filters.\n   - Implied that experience in scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms is critical, so skills must be specific.\n   - The broad U.S. location filter assumes no regional preference within the U.S.\n\n4. **VALIDATION CHECKS**\n\n   - Ensure literal match for job titles to avoid inclusion of broader roles.\n   - Verify that skills and company tenure align with the requirement for a strong track record.\n   - Location filter should be broad enough to include all U.S.-based candidates.\n\n5. **FEEDBACK INCORPORATION**\n\n   - No specific feedback was provided, so the focus remains on precision and adherence to system learnings.\n   - Emphasized the importance of exact job title matching and relevant skills in addressing the requirement.\n\n6. **FINAL FILTER JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [{\"title_name\": \"Chief Marketing Officer\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [\"U.S.\"],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": 3, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [\"scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms\"]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure integrates the solutions effectively by mapping explicit requirements to the filter values, ensuring logical consistency and comprehensive coverage without redundant or conflicting values.",
