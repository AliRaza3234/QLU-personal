DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n#### Job Title/Business Function\n- **Analysis**: The requirement specifically seeks candidates with the job title \"Chief Marketing Officer\" (CMO), emphasizing precise matching without broader inclusions like VP or Director roles.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: The focus is on the current role, as the query specifies finding a CMO, suggesting they should currently hold this position.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Feedback emphasizes the exact title, aligning with the requirement to avoid broader roles.\n\n#### Location\n- **Analysis**: The requirement specifies candidates based in the U.S., suggesting a broad initial filter with the flexibility to refine based on specific regional feedback.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: The location is current, as the query seeks candidates presently based in the U.S.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback was provided, but the broad U.S. focus aligns with the original requirement.\n\n#### Experience\n- **Analysis**: The focus is on candidates with a strong track record in scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms. This involves a combination of skill and tenure filters to capture both technical and strategic expertise.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: The requirement is for both current and past experiences since it involves a track record, indicating achievements over time.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Emphasizes both strategic and technical experience, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the candidate's capabilities.\n\n#### Industry\n- **Analysis**: The industry filter needs to target AI-driven SaaS platforms, requiring precise targeting to ensure relevance.\n- **Temporal Aspect**: The experience should be both current and past as it relates to the overall track record in the industry.\n- **Feedback Influence**: No specific feedback was provided, but the emphasis is on precise industry targeting.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: Use \"Chief Marketing Officer\" and \"CMO\" to ensure precise matching. Set the event to \"CURRENT\" as the candidate should currently hold this position.\n- **Location**: Set to \"U.S.\" with the event as \"CURRENT\" to align with the requirement for candidates based in the U.S.\n- **Skills**: Include skills like \"scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms,\" \"AI technology implementation,\" and \"SaaS scaling methodologies\" to ensure candidates have the relevant expertise.\n- **Company Tenure**: Minimum of 2+ years to demonstrate a track record in impactful roles.\n- **Role Tenure**: Minimum of 1+ year to ensure recent relevant experience.\n- **Industry**: Include \"SaaS\" and relevant roles like \"AI Specialist,\" \"SaaS Architect,\" and \"Machine Learning Engineer\" to capture industry experience.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- **Temporal Assumptions**: Current roles and experiences are prioritized based on the query's focus on current capabilities.\n- **Implicit Requirements**: The need for candidates to demonstrate both strategic and technical expertise in scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Skills, tenure, and industry filters are interdependent to ensure candidates meet comprehensive criteria.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- **Consistency**: Filters must align with the query's requirements and ensure logical consistency across temporal and categorical aspects.\n- **Compatibility**: Ensure filters are compatible with system capabilities and do not conflict with broader search terms.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- **Feedback Consideration**: Emphasized precise title matching and avoided broader roles. Location feedback was minimal, but broad U.S. targeting aligns with requirements.\n- **Learning Integration**: Applied learnings about the importance of explicit action verbs and tenure in filtering relevant experiences.\n\n### 6.
