DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n#### Solution 1:\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Focuses on job titles like \"Chief Marketing Officer\" and ensuring broad geographic scope.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Include titles related to CMO roles.\n- **Implicit Requirements**: Avoid geographic restrictions to Eastern Europe.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Primarily focuses on current roles.\n- **Dependencies**: Relies on job title filters; no geographic constraints are implicitly set.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Strong emphasis on avoiding Eastern Europe by not setting constraints.\n- **Existing Filters**: Aligns with existing job title values.\n\n#### Solution 2:\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Reinforces the need for U.S.-based candidates.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Location filter strictly for the United States.\n- **Implicit Requirements**: Exclusion of non-U.S. candidates.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Applies to current location.\n- **Dependencies**: Strong dependency on accurate location data.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Directly responds to feedback about Eastern Europe representation.\n- **Existing Filters**: Uses the existing \"United States\" filter value.\n\n#### Solution 3:\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Introduces the need for sales experience.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Filter for sales experience in SaaS.\n- **Implicit Requirements**: Sales experience should be relevant to SaaS.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Requires both current and past experience.\n- **Dependencies**: Relies on experience and skills integration.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Addresses feedback by focusing on sales experience.\n- **Existing Filters**: Builds on existing experience and skills filters.\n\n#### Solution 4:\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Focuses on industry filters specific to AI-driven SaaS.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Industries like \"AI-driven SaaS\" and \"AI-based Marketing Technology\".\n- **Implicit Requirements**: Ensure these industries include sales roles.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Applies to both current and past industries.\n- **Dependencies**: Industry filter should align with job titles and skills.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Addresses the need for industry specificity.\n- **Existing Filters**: Compatible with existing industry filters but more specific.\n\n#### Solution 5:\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure**: Establishes a filter for past sales roles.\n- **Explicit Requirements**: Past job titles in sales.\n- **Implicit Requirements**: Sales roles should be significant in the candidate's history.\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Focus on past roles.\n- **Dependencies**: Complements current job title and industry filters.\n- **Feedback Influence**: Emphasizes past sales experience as critical.\n- **Existing Filters**: New addition to existing filter structure.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Titles/Business Function**: Include \"Chief Marketing Officer\" and equivalents. Focus is on current roles with a broad geographic allowance.\n- **Location**: Strictly the United States to address feedback about Eastern Europe.\n- **Skills**: Include skills related to SaaS marketing and AI/ML product marketing.\n- **Experience**: Emphasize sales experience in SaaS, considering both current and past roles.\n- **Industries**: Refine to focus on \"AI-driven SaaS\" and related areas.\n- **Management Level and Company**: No specific changes needed here based on solutions.\n- **Education, School, Current Ownership, Name, Ethnicity, Age, Total Working Years, Role Tenure, Company Tenure**: No new requirements or changes based on solutions.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- **Assumption**: The focus is on candidates currently in the U.S. with past sales experience.\n- **Implication**: This may exclude candidates temporarily abroad but meeting other criteria.\n  \n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensure the filters do not include implicit geographic limits beyond the U.S.\n- Validate that sales experience is captured accurately in both current and past contexts.\n- Confirm industry filters are distinct and focus on AI-driven SaaS.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\nFeedback about Eastern Europe is addressed by strictly using U.S. location filters. The focus on past sales experience is directly integrated into the solutions.\n\n### 6.
