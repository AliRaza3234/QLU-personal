        "reasoning_and_analysis": "### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n**Solution 1: Job Title - Chief Marketing Officer**\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure:** This maps directly to the \"job_title/business_function\" filter. The requirement is to match candidates strictly with the title of Chief Marketing Officer.\n- **Explicit vs Implicit Requirements:** Explicitly requires the exact job title. Implicitly, it suggests precision over inclusion of similar roles.\n- **Temporal Aspect:** This applies to both current and past roles, as the title could have been held at any point.\n- **Dependencies:** No direct dependencies; this is a standalone filter criterion.\n- **Feedback Influence:** No feedback was given for this title, but the solution suggests using an exact match to avoid ambiguity.\n- **Existing Values:** Aligns with the existing requirement for Chief Marketing Officer.\n\n**Solution 2: Scaling Experience in AI-driven SaaS**\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure:** This could map to a custom filter under \"skills\" or be integrated through \"job_title/business_function\" with specific achievements.\n- **Explicit vs Implicit Requirements:** Requires documented experience in scaling AI-driven SaaS platforms. Implicitly assumes availability of such data.\n- **Temporal Aspect:** Could apply to both current and past experiences.\n- **Dependencies:** Requires candidate data to include specific scaling metrics.\n- **Feedback Influence:** No direct feedback, but solution focuses on quantitative aspects which are practical for filtering.\n- **Existing Values:** Expands on existing AI-driven SaaS industry focus with specific scaling achievements.\n\n**Solution 3: Location - U.S.**\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure:** Maps to the \"location\" filter.\n- **Explicit vs Implicit Requirements:** Explicitly requires candidates to be based in the U.S.; implicitly excludes other regions.\n- **Temporal Aspect:** Applies to current location, with an additional check for work location.\n- **Dependencies:** May depend on candidate data accuracy for current and work location.\n- **Feedback Influence:** Directly addresses feedback to reduce Eastern European candidates.\n- **Existing Values:** Enhances the existing U.S. location filter by adding a secondary check for work location.\n\n**Solution 4: Past Sales Experience**\n- **Mapping to Filter Structure:** Maps to the \"job_title/business_function\" filter, focusing on past roles.\n- **Explicit vs Implicit Requirements:** Explicitly requires past experience in sales roles. Implicitly excludes candidates without this history.\n- **Temporal Aspect:** Specifically for past roles.\n- **Dependencies:** Relies on accurate historical job data.\n- **Feedback Influence:** Strong feedback influence, emphasizing the need for past sales experience.\n- **Existing Values:** Aligns with existing emphasis on sales experience.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function:** Use an exact match for \"Chief Marketing Officer\" to ensure precision and relevance.\n- **Scaling Experience:** Include specific scaling metrics relevant to AI-driven SaaS platforms, integrated through the skills or achievements filter.\n- **Location:** Incorporate a dual-filter approach for \"U.S.\" and \"Current work location: U.S.\" to address feedback and ensure candidates are U.S.-based.\n- **Sales Experience:** Use a past filter for sales experience to comply with feedback, ensuring candidates have held sales roles.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- Assumed availability of detailed candidate performance metrics for scaling experience.\n- Implications include a possibly narrower candidate pool due to strict filters but increased relevance and quality of results.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensure candidate data supports detailed metrics for scaling experience.\n- Confirm dual-location filter reduces non-U.S. candidates effectively.\n- Verify past sales experience is adequately documented in candidate profiles.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\nFeedback has been incorporated by:\n- Enhancing location specificity to reduce Eastern European candidates.\n- Emphasizing past sales roles to meet specific client requirements.\n\n### 6.
