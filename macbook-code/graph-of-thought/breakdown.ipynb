      "  \"reasoning_and_analysis\": \"### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\\n\\nLet's analyze each component of the solutions and how they fit into the filter structure:\\n\\n**a. Job Title/Business Function:**\\n- The primary focus is on identifying VP-level roles. The solutions suggest specific titles such as \\\"Vice President,\\\" \\\"VP,\\\" \\\"Senior Vice President,\\\" and \\\"Executive Vice President.\\\"\\n- Additionally, the requirement is to identify those who have previously worked as a \\\"Salesman\\\" or similar roles like \\\"Sales Representative,\\\" \\\"Sales Associate,\\\" and \\\"Sales Executive.\\\"\\n- The temporal aspect is important here, as we need to distinguish between current roles (VP-level) and past roles (Salesman).\\n\\n**b. Company:**\\n- The focus is on candidates associated with AI companies. A list of well-known AI companies, such as \\\"OpenAI,\\\" \\\"DeepMind,\\\" and others, is provided.\\n- The requirement is to consider candidates who are currently or have previously been employed by these companies.\\n\\n**c. Location:**\\n- The candidates must be located in Western Europe. A list of countries typically considered part of Western Europe includes Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, and Switzerland.\\n- This needs to be applied to their current location.\\n\\n**d. Total Working Years:**\\n- The requirement is for candidates with over 30 years of experience. This is a straightforward filter.\\n\\n**e. Skills:**\\n- Candidates must have expertise in corporate finance. Skills such as \\\"Financial Analysis,\\\" \\\"Budgeting,\\\" and \\\"Mergers and Acquisitions\\\" are relevant here.\\n- Certifications like CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) are also important.\\n\\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\\n\\n**a. Job Title/Business Function:**\\n- **Current**: Include titles like \\\"Vice President,\\\" \\\"VP,\\\" \\\"Senior Vice President,\\\" \\\"Executive Vice President.\\\"\\n- **Past**: Include titles like \\\"Salesman,\\\" \\\"Sales Representative,\\\" \\\"Sales Associate,\\\" \\\"Sales Executive.\\\"\\n- **Event**: \\\"CURRENT AND PAST\\\" because the requirement is to find candidates who currently hold a VP-level position and have previously worked as a salesman.\\n\\n**b. Company:**\\n- **Current Prompt**: Include well-known AI companies.\\n- **Past Prompt**: Same list as current, since the requirement is for either current or past employment.\\n- **Event**: \\\"CURRENT OR PAST\\\" to capture those who have been involved with AI companies at any point.\\n\\n**c. Location:**\\n- **Current**: List of Western European countries.\\n- **Event**: \\\"CURRENT\\\" because the current location is specified in the requirement.\\n\\n**d. Total Working Years:**\\n- **Min**: 30\\n- **Max**: Null (not specified)\\n\\n**e. Skills:**\\n- Include skills related to corporate finance and certifications like CFA.\\n\\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\\n\\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Ensure clear demarcation between current VP roles and past Salesman roles.\\n- **Logical Dependencies**: The presence of a VP title currently does not negate the need for past sales experience. Both are required.\\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None identified, as all filters are complementary.\\n\\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\\n\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure all values, especially company names and locations, are correctly matched and validated against the database.\\n- **Completeness**: Verify that all necessary filters, like skills and experience years, are included and accurately represented.\\n\\n### 5. FINAL FILTER JSON\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"job_title/business_function\\\": {\\n        \\\"current\\\": [\\n            {\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"Vice President\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000},\\n            {\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"VP\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000},\\n            {\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"Senior Vice President\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000},\\n            {\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"Executive Vice President\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}\\n        ],\\n        \\\"past\\\": [\\n            {\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"Salesman\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000},\\n            {\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"Sales Representative\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000},\\n            {\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"Sales Associate\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000},\\n            {\\\"title_name\\\": \\\"Sales Executive\\\", \\\"min_staff\\\": 0, \\\"max_staff\\\": 50000000}\\n        ],\\n        \\\"both\\\": [],\\n        \\\"event\\\": \\\"CURRENT AND PAST\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"management_level\\\": {\\n        \\\"current\\\": [],\\n        \\\"past\\\": [],\\n        \\\"both\\\": [],\\n        \\\"event\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"location\\\": {\\n        \\\"current\\\": [\\n            \\\"Austria\\\", \\\"Belgium\\\", \\\"France\\\", \\\"Germany\\\", \\\"Liechtenstein\\\", \\n            \\\"Luxembourg\\\", \\\"Monaco\\\", \\\"Netherlands\\\", \\\"Switzerland\\\"\\n        ],\\n        \\\"past\\\": [],\\n        \\\"both\\\": [],\\n        \\\"event\\\": \\\"CURRENT\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"company\\\": {\\n        \\\"current_prompt\\\": \\\"OpenAI, DeepMind, NVIDIA, Google AI, IBM Watson, Microsoft AI, Amazon AI, Baidu AI, Tencent AI, Alibaba AI\\\",\\n        \\\"past_prompt\\\": \\\"OpenAI, DeepMind, NVIDIA, Google AI, IBM Watson, Microsoft AI, Amazon AI, Baidu AI, Tencent AI, Alibaba AI\\\",\\n        \\\"event\\\": \\\"CURRENT OR PAST\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"education\\\": [],\\n    \\\"school\\\": [],\\n    \\\"current_ownership\\\": [],\\n    \\\"name\\\": [],\\n    \\\"ethnicity\\\": [],\\n    \\\"age\\\": [],\\n    \\\"total_working_years\\\": {\\\"min\\\": 30, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n    \\\"role_tenure\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n    \\\"company_tenure\\\": {\\\"min\\\": null, \\\"max\\\": null},\\n    \\\"skills\\\": [\\n        \\\"Financial Analysis\\\", \\\"Budgeting\\\", \\\"Mergers and Acquisitions\\\", \\\"CFA\\\"\\n    ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis JSON filter structure comprehensively captures the requirements of the original query, ensuring that the correct candidates are identified based on the specified filters.\",\n",

The solutions present a multi-faceted approach to defining seniority, focusing on job titles, years of experience, leadership roles, and achievements. The feedback emphasizes a need to focus specifically on senior sales executives, not just any sales executives.\\n\\n2. **REASONING FOR EACH FILTER**\\n\\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: The first solution focuses on specific job titles that indicate seniority, like \\\"Senior Sales Executive,\\\" \\\"Lead Sales Executive,\\\" and \\\"Sales Manager.\\\" This directly maps to the \\\"job_title/business_function\\\" filter. By including these titles, we align with the feedback to target senior roles explicitly.\\n\\n- **Total Working Years**: The second solution suggests using years of experience as a seniority marker, proposing a threshold of 10+ years. This maps to the \\\"total_working_years\\\" filter, ensuring candidates have significant work experience.\\n\\n- **Management Level**: Leadership roles are a critical indicator of seniority. The second solution proposes considering leadership experience, which maps to the \\\"management_level\\\" filter. This can be set to include individuals with current or past leadership roles.\\n\\n- **Education, Skills, and Achievements**: While achievements were considered, their subjective nature and inconsistent recording make them less reliable for filtering. Thus, they are not explicitly included, focusing instead on more quantifiable criteria like titles and experience.\\n\\n3. **ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS**\\n\\n- We assume that the job titles provided cover a broad range of senior sales roles.

FEEDBACK FOCUS: Deeply analyze any provided feedback and make it the central guiding principle of your analysis\\n        2. ATOMICITY: Break down queries into truly atomic sub-problems (each addressing ONE specific aspect only)\\n        3. FILTER AWARENESS: Carefully consider existing filter values when analyzing the query\\n        4. INTENT UNDERSTANDING: Comprehend the main intent of the recruitment query\\n        \\n        Key principles for FEEDBACK incorporation:\\n        - Treat feedback as the highest priority guidance for your analysis\\n        - Explicitly connect each piece of feedback to specific atomic sub-problems\\n        - If feedback contradicts the original query, prioritize the feedback's direction\\n        - Use feedback to refine, modify, or completely change your understanding of requirements\\n        - For each atomic sub-problem, include SPECIFIC quotes from the feedback that are relevant\\n        \\n        Key principles for ATOMIC SUB-PROBLEM creation:\\n        - Each sub-problem must address EXACTLY ONE specific requirement or concept\\n        - If a potential sub-problem addresses multiple requirements, split it further\\n        - Test each sub-problem with the question: \\\"Does this solve exactly one thing?\\\"\\n        - Avoid compound requirements within a single sub-problem\\n        - Ensure each sub-problem has a singular, clear focus\\n        \\n        For each ATOMIC sub-problem, you must:\\n        1. Focus on a single, specific aspect of the requirement\\n        2. Connect relevant feedback specifically to this atomic element\\n        3. Identify which specific filter values (if any) relate to this single element\\n        4. Assign appropriate priority (1-5, 1 being highest)\\n        5. Explicitly state dependencies on other atomic sub-problems\\n        \\n        Your analysis process should follow these steps:\\n        1. First, thoroughly analyze the feedback to identify key guidance points\\n        2. Second, examine existing filter values to understand constraints\\n        3. Third, break down the query into the smallest possible atomic sub-problems\\n        4.

FEEDBACK FOCUS: Deeply analyze any provided feedback and make it the central guiding principle of your analysis\\n        2. ATOMICITY: Break down queries into truly atomic sub-problems (each addressing ONE specific aspect only)\\n        3. FILTER AWARENESS: Carefully consider existing filter values when analyzing the query\\n        4. LEARNING INTEGRATION: Apply relevant system learnings to each atomic sub-problem\\n        5. INTENT UNDERSTANDING: Comprehend the main intent of the recruitment query\\n        \\n        Key principles for FEEDBACK incorporation:\\n        - Treat feedback as the highest priority guidance for your analysis\\n        - Explicitly connect each piece of feedback to specific atomic sub-problems\\n        - If feedback contradicts the original query, prioritize the feedback's direction\\n        - Use feedback to refine, modify, or completely change your understanding of requirements\\n        - For each atomic sub-problem, include SPECIFIC quotes from the feedback that are relevant\\n        \\n        Key principles for ATOMIC SUB-PROBLEM creation:\\n        - Each sub-problem must address EXACTLY ONE specific requirement or concept\\n        - If a potential sub-problem addresses multiple requirements, split it further\\n        - Test each sub-problem with the question: \\\"Does this solve exactly one thing?\\\"\\n        - Avoid compound requirements within a single sub-problem\\n        - Ensure each sub-problem has a singular, clear focus\\n        \\n        Key principles for LEARNING INTEGRATION:\\n        - For each sub-problem, identify SPECIFIC relevant learnings that apply\\n        - Only associate learnings that directly inform or constrain the specific sub-problem\\n        - Extract only the portions of learnings that are relevant to each atomic element\\n        - Prioritize learnings that address similar requirements to the current sub-problem\\n        - Connect each learning to the specific reasoning it enables for the sub-problem\\n        \\n        For each ATOMIC sub-problem, you must:\\n        1. Focus on a single, specific aspect of the requirement\\n        2. Connect relevant feedback specifically to this atomic element\\n        3. Identify which specific filter values (if any) relate to this single element\\n        4. Extract relevant system learnings specifically applicable to this element\\n        5. Assign appropriate priority (1-5, 1 being highest)\\n        6. Explicitly state dependencies on other atomic sub-problems\\n        \\n        Your analysis process should follow these steps:\\n        1. First, thoroughly analyze the feedback to identify key guidance points\\n        2. Second, examine existing filter values to understand constraints\\n        3. Third, review system learnings to identify relevant past solutions\\n        4. Fourth, break down the query into the smallest possible atomic sub-problems\\n        5.

FEEDBACK FOCUS: Deeply analyze any provided feedback and make it the central guiding principle of your analysis\\n        2. ATOMICITY: Break down queries into truly atomic sub-problems (each addressing ONE specific aspect only)\\n        3. FILTER AWARENESS: Carefully consider existing filter values when analyzing the query\\n        4. LEARNING INTEGRATION: Apply relevant system learnings to each atomic sub-problem\\n        5. INTENT UNDERSTANDING: Comprehend the main intent of the recruitment query\\n        \\n        Key principles for FEEDBACK incorporation:\\n        - Treat feedback as the highest priority guidance for your analysis\\n        - Explicitly connect each piece of feedback to specific atomic sub-problems\\n        - If feedback contradicts the original query, prioritize the feedback's direction\\n        - Use feedback to refine, modify, or completely change your understanding of requirements\\n        - For each atomic sub-problem, include SPECIFIC quotes from the feedback that are relevant\\n        \\n        Key principles for ATOMIC SUB-PROBLEM creation:\\n        - Each sub-problem must address EXACTLY ONE specific requirement or concept\\n        - If a potential sub-problem addresses multiple requirements, split it further\\n        - Test each sub-problem with the question: \\\"Does this solve exactly one thing?\\\"\\n        - Avoid compound requirements within a single sub-problem\\n        - Ensure each sub-problem has a singular, clear focus\\n        \\n        Key principles for LEARNING INTEGRATION:\\n        - For each sub-problem, identify SPECIFIC relevant learnings that apply\\n        - Only associate learnings that directly inform or constrain the specific sub-problem\\n        - Extract only the portions of learnings that are relevant to each atomic element\\n        - Prioritize learnings that address similar requirements to the current sub-problem\\n        - Connect each learning to the specific reasoning it enables for the sub-problem\\n        \\n        For each ATOMIC sub-problem, you must:\\n        1. Focus on a single, specific aspect of the requirement\\n        2. Connect relevant feedback specifically to this atomic element\\n        3. Identify which specific filter values (if any) relate to this single element\\n        4. Extract relevant system learnings specifically applicable to this element\\n        5. Assign appropriate priority (1-5, 1 being highest)\\n        6. Explicitly state dependencies on other atomic sub-problems\\n        \\n        Your analysis process should follow these steps:\\n        1. First, thoroughly analyze the feedback to identify key guidance points\\n        2. Second, examine existing filter values to understand constraints\\n        3. Third, review system learnings to identify relevant past solutions\\n        4. Fourth, break down the query into the smallest possible atomic sub-problems\\n        5.
