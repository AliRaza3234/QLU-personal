        "reasoning_and_analysis": "### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\nLet's analyze each component of the solutions and how they fit into the filter structure:\n\n**a. Job Title/Business Function:**\n- The primary focus is on identifying VP-level roles. The solutions suggest specific titles such as \"Vice President,\" \"VP,\" \"Senior Vice President,\" and \"Executive Vice President.\"\n- Additionally, the requirement is to identify those who have previously worked as a \"Salesman\" or similar roles like \"Sales Representative,\" \"Sales Associate,\" and \"Sales Executive.\"\n- The temporal aspect is important here, as we need to distinguish between current roles (VP-level) and past roles (Salesman).\n\n**b. Company:**\n- The focus is on candidates associated with AI companies. A list of well-known AI companies, such as \"OpenAI,\" \"DeepMind,\" and others, is provided.\n- The requirement is to consider candidates who are currently or have previously been employed by these companies.\n\n**c. Location:**\n- The candidates must be located in Western Europe. A list of countries typically considered part of Western Europe includes Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, and Switzerland.\n- This needs to be applied to their current location.\n\n**d. Total Working Years:**\n- The requirement is for candidates with over 30 years of experience. This is a straightforward filter.\n\n**e. Skills:**\n- Candidates must have expertise in corporate finance. Skills such as \"Financial Analysis,\" \"Budgeting,\" and \"Mergers and Acquisitions\" are relevant here.\n- Certifications like CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) are also important.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n**a. Job Title/Business Function:**\n- **Current**: Include titles like \"Vice President,\" \"VP,\" \"Senior Vice President,\" \"Executive Vice President.\"\n- **Past**: Include titles like \"Salesman,\" \"Sales Representative,\" \"Sales Associate,\" \"Sales Executive.\"\n- **Event**: \"CURRENT AND PAST\" because the requirement is to find candidates who currently hold a VP-level position and have previously worked as a salesman.\n\n**b. Company:**\n- **Current Prompt**: Include well-known AI companies.\n- **Past Prompt**: Same list as current, since the requirement is for either current or past employment.\n- **Event**: \"CURRENT OR PAST\" to capture those who have been involved with AI companies at any point.\n\n**c. Location:**\n- **Current**: List of Western European countries.\n- **Event**: \"CURRENT\" because the current location is specified in the requirement.\n\n**d. Total Working Years:**\n- **Min**: 30\n- **Max**: Null (not specified)\n\n**e. Skills:**\n- Include skills related to corporate finance and certifications like CFA.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- **Temporal Aspects**: Ensure clear demarcation between current VP roles and past Salesman roles.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: The presence of a VP title currently does not negate the need for past sales experience. Both are required.\n- **Potential Conflicts**: None identified, as all filters are complementary.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- **Consistency**: Ensure all values, especially company names and locations, are correctly matched and validated against the database.\n- **Completeness**: Verify that all necessary filters, like skills and experience years, are included and accurately represented.\n\n### 5. FINAL FILTER JSON\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [\n            {\"title_name\": \"Vice President\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"VP\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Senior Vice President\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Executive Vice President\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}\n        ],\n        \"past\": [\n            {\"title_name\": \"Salesman\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Sales Representative\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Sales Associate\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Sales Executive\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}\n        ],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT AND PAST\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [\n            \"Austria\", \"Belgium\", \"France\", \"Germany\", \"Liechtenstein\", \n            \"Luxembourg\", \"Monaco\", \"Netherlands\", \"Switzerland\"\n        ],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"OpenAI, DeepMind, NVIDIA, Google AI, IBM Watson, Microsoft AI, Amazon AI, Baidu AI, Tencent AI, Alibaba AI\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"OpenAI, DeepMind, NVIDIA, Google AI, IBM Watson, Microsoft AI, Amazon AI, Baidu AI, Tencent AI, Alibaba AI\",\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": 30, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [\n        \"Financial Analysis\", \"Budgeting\", \"Mergers and Acquisitions\", \"CFA\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON filter structure comprehensively captures the requirements of the original query, ensuring that the correct candidates are identified based on the specified filters.",
