        "reasoning_and_analysis": "### 1. DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n#### Solution Components Mapping to Filter Structure:\n\n1. **Job Title/Business Function**:\n    - The requirement is to filter candidates with titles such as \"Chief Marketing Officer\" or equivalent roles. The feedback suggests refining the list to avoid non-CMO roles.\n    - Include past experience in sales roles, which indicates a need for integration of past roles related to sales.\n    - Temporal aspect: Separate current and past roles to distinguish between their current role as CMO and past sales experience.\n\n2. **Management Level**:\n    - Focus on C-suite or equivalent senior roles, which aligns with the feedback to exclude broader titles like \"VP\" unless they are directly related to marketing.\n\n3. **Location**:\n    - Original focus was on U.S.-based candidates. Feedback suggests broadening this to include other major English-speaking countries and relevant tech hubs to ensure diversity.\n\n4. **Skills**:\n    - Skills related to scaling SaaS platforms and AI-driven initiatives. The feedback and solutions suggest adding more specific skills like \"Sales Leadership in SaaS\" and \"Revenue Growth in Tech\".\n\n5. **Experience**:\n    - Explicitly target past sales experience through roles like \"Sales Manager\" or \"Sales Representative\".\n\n6. **Company**:\n    - Although not directly addressed in the solutions, the existing filters suggest a preference for candidates from recognized AI-driven SaaS companies.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**:\n  - Current: Focus on precise titles like \"Chief Marketing Officer\", \"Head of Marketing\", etc.\n  - Past: Include roles that indicate sales experience.\n  - Both: Not applicable here due to distinct separation of roles.\n  - Event: \"CURRENT OR PAST\" to encompass both current CMO roles and past sales roles.\n\n- **Management Level**:\n  - Current: \"C Suite\", \"Executive and Sr. VP\" for marketing roles.\n  - Past: Similar to current, but only if they had significant sales responsibilities.\n  - Event: \"CURRENT\" to ensure focus on current senior marketing positions.\n\n- **Location**:\n  - Current: Include U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia to broaden the pool.\n  - Event: \"CURRENT OR PAST\" to cover possible relocation.\n\n- **Skills**:\n  - Integrate skills related to SaaS and AI with a focus on growth and sales leadership.\n\n- **Experience**:\n  - Reflect past sales roles specifically.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- Assumption that equivalent roles in marketing leadership are acceptable under \"CMO\" umbrella.\n- Implicit requirement for candidates to have a blend of CMO and sales experience.\n- Temporal aspect: Current roles focus on marketing leadership, past roles focus on sales.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- Ensure role titles align with job responsibilities.\n- Validate that location broadening does not dilute U.S. preference excessively.\n- Check for any overlaps between skills and experience filters.\n\n### 5. FEEDBACK INCORPORATION\n\n- Addressed the feedback by refining job titles, including more diverse locations, and targeting past sales roles.\n- Excluded overly broad management titles and focused on high-level roles directly related to marketing.\n\n### 6.
