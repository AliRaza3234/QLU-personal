The solutions present a multi-faceted approach to defining seniority, focusing on job titles, years of experience, leadership roles, and achievements. The feedback emphasizes a need to focus specifically on senior sales executives, not just any sales executives.\n\n2. **REASONING FOR EACH FILTER**\n\n- **Job Title/Business Function**: The first solution focuses on specific job titles that indicate seniority, like \"Senior Sales Executive,\" \"Lead Sales Executive,\" and \"Sales Manager.\" This directly maps to the \"job_title/business_function\" filter. By including these titles, we align with the feedback to target senior roles explicitly.\n\n- **Total Working Years**: The second solution suggests using years of experience as a seniority marker, proposing a threshold of 10+ years. This maps to the \"total_working_years\" filter, ensuring candidates have significant work experience.\n\n- **Management Level**: Leadership roles are a critical indicator of seniority. The second solution proposes considering leadership experience, which maps to the \"management_level\" filter. This can be set to include individuals with current or past leadership roles.\n\n- **Education, Skills, and Achievements**: While achievements were considered, their subjective nature and inconsistent recording make them less reliable for filtering. Thus, they are not explicitly included, focusing instead on more quantifiable criteria like titles and experience.\n\n3. **ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS**\n\n- We assume that the job titles provided cover a broad range of senior sales roles. However, there may be unconventional titles that imply seniority but are not included.\n- The assumption is that 10+ years of experience generally correlates with seniority in sales roles, although rapid career advancement could mean fewer years might also suffice.\n- Leadership roles are assumed to be a strong indicator of seniority, implying significant responsibilities.\n\n4. **VALIDATION CHECKS**\n\n- Ensure the job title filter recognizes synonyms and variations that imply seniority.\n- Confirm that the database or resume parsing can accurately assess years of experience and identify leadership roles.\n- Regularly update the job title list to reflect industry changes.\n\n5. **FINAL FILTER JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [\n            {\"title_name\": \"Senior Sales Executive\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Lead Sales Executive\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Sales Manager\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}\n        ],\n        \"past\": [\n            {\"title_name\": \"Senior Sales Executive\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Lead Sales Executive\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Sales Manager\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}\n        ],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [\"Leadership\"],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"\",\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": 10, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": []\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure reflects a comprehensive approach to identifying senior sales executives, integrating both explicit feedback and implicit requirements for seniority.
