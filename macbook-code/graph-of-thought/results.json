DETAILED ANALYSIS\n\n**Solution 1: VP-Level Leaders**\n- **Mapped Filter**: `job_title/business_function`\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Identify candidates with VP-level or equivalent job titles.\n- **Implicit Requirement**: Consider organizational variations in titles.\n- **Temporal Consideration**: Focus on current and past roles to capture a comprehensive career trajectory.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: This filter is dependent on understanding organizational hierarchies and common titles associated with VP equivalency.\n\n**Solution 2: Location in Western Europe**\n- **Mapped Filter**: `location`\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Candidates must be based in Western Europe.\n- **Implicit Requirement**: Define which countries are considered Western Europe.\n- **Temporal Consideration**: Focus on the current location of candidates.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: This filter relies on geographic definitions and clarity on which countries are included.\n\n**Solution 3: Over 30 Years of Professional Experience**\n- **Mapped Filter**: `total_working_years`\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Candidates must have more than 30 years of experience.\n- **Implicit Requirement**: Ensure accurate recording of experience data.\n- **Temporal Consideration**: Total years regardless of current or past experiences.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: This filter requires accurate historical data on candidate experience.\n\n**Solution 4: Expertise in Corporate Finance**\n- **Mapped Filter**: `skills`\n- **Explicit Requirement**: Identify candidates with expertise in corporate finance.\n- **Implicit Requirement**: Candidates must explicitly list corporate finance as a skill or have held relevant job titles.\n- **Temporal Consideration**: Consider current skills and responsibilities.\n- **Logical Dependencies**: Relies on accurate profiling of skills and roles associated with corporate finance.\n\n### 2. REASONING FOR EACH FILTER\n\n- **job_title/business_function**: Selected titles like \"Vice President,\" \"Senior Vice President,\" \"Executive Vice President,\" and \"Chief Officer\" ensure coverage of VP-level roles. This choice balances inclusivity and specificity.\n  \n- **location**: Using a predefined list of Western European countries ensures comprehensive coverage and aligns with geographical norms. This list includes Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, UK, and Denmark.\n\n- **total_working_years**: Setting this to a minimum of 31 years ensures candidates meet the experience threshold while avoiding exclusion of those just meeting the criteria.\n\n- **skills**: Filtering for \"corporate finance\" as a skill directly targets the required expertise. This ensures candidates possess the necessary domain knowledge.\n\n### 3. ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS\n\n- **Assumption**: The geographical filter accurately represents all countries in Western Europe. This assumes no major geopolitical changes affecting these boundaries.\n- **Implication**: Using job titles as a filter assumes candidates have consistent and accurate job title data in their profiles.\n\n### 4. VALIDATION CHECKS\n\n- **Consistency**: Ensure job titles and skills are consistently represented across candidate profiles.\n- **Accuracy**: Validate geographical data to ensure all included countries are correctly labeled as Western Europe.\n- **Completeness**: Verify that the total years of experience are accurately calculated and recorded.\n\n### 5.

        "reasoning_and_analysis": "1. **DETAILED ANALYSIS**\n\n   The original query and solutions provided focus on identifying candidates for high-level executive roles within specific industries (architectural lighting, commercial illumination, smart building technologies) who possess a broad skill set ranging from technical expertise to strategic management. The solutions propose various filtering techniques, each emphasizing different aspects of the requirements. The challenge is to synthesize these into a coherent filter structure that captures all relevant criteria and aligns with the provided JSON format.\n\n2. **REASONING FOR EACH FILTER**\n\n   - **Job Title/Business Function**: The focus is on high-level titles such as \"Executive Vice President,\" \"General Manager,\" and similar roles. Given the solutions' emphasis on flexibility to capture variations, the \"both\" filter is used. This aligns with the solution's approach to include different executive titles across current and past roles.\n   \n   - **Management Level**: The solutions implicitly suggest targeting senior management roles. Therefore, setting \"both\" to include senior-level management roles aligns with the focus on strategic leadership and management within the industry.\n   \n   - **Location**: No explicit location filter is detailed in the solutions, so this remains empty unless specific geographic criteria are added.\n   \n   - **Company**: Since the solutions emphasize companies in specific industries, the \"current_prompt\" and \"past_prompt\" can reflect companies specializing in architectural lighting, commercial illumination, and smart building technologies. However, this is more about industry specialization rather than specific companies by name.\n   \n   - **Education**: The solutions don't focus on educational qualifications or specific degrees, so this remains empty unless explicit educational requirements are identified.\n   \n   - **School**: Not specified in the solutions; therefore, no entries are added.\n   \n   - **Current Ownership**: Not relevant to the solutions provided.\n   \n   - **Name**: No specific names are mentioned; hence, no entries.\n   \n   - **Ethnicity**: Not addressed in the solutions, so no entries are included.\n   \n   - **Age**: Not a focus in the solutions, and therefore no entries are included.\n   \n   - **Total Working Years**: This could be inferred but is not explicitly discussed in the solutions. If experience level is a focus, a minimum of 10-15 years could be assumed, but this remains null as it's not directly specified.\n   \n   - **Role Tenure**: Not explicitly detailed, so remains null.\n   \n   - **Company Tenure**: Not explicitly detailed, so remains null.\n   \n   - **Skills**: The solutions heavily focus on skills such as \"LED lighting,\" \"energy-efficient systems,\" \"IoT-enabled lighting controls,\" \"strategic leadership,\" \"operational management,\" \"business development,\" and others. These are directly added to the skills filter.\n   \n3. **ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS**\n\n   - **Temporal Aspects**: The solutions do not specify temporal constraints (current vs. past), so we assume the criteria apply to both current and past roles unless specified otherwise.\n   - **Logical Dependencies**: Skills and industry experience are interdependent, emphasizing the need for both technical and managerial competencies.\n   - **Potential Conflicts**: Broad job titles might include candidates who do not precisely fit the requirements, but this is balanced by the inclusion of relevant skills and industry keywords.\n\n4. **VALIDATION CHECKS**\n\n   - Ensure all filters are logically consistent and align with the intended purpose of identifying suitable candidates for high-level executive roles.\n   - Validate that all skills and industry keywords are accurately represented in the candidate profiles.\n   - Confirm that the filter structure accommodates flexibility where necessary, such as in job titles and industry specializations.\n\n5. **FINAL FILTER JSON**\n\n```json\n{\n    \"job_title/business_function\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [\n            {\"title_name\": \"Executive Vice President\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"General Manager\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Senior Vice President\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Chief Operating Officer\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000},\n            {\"title_name\": \"Managing Director\", \"min_staff\": 0, \"max_staff\": 50000000}\n        ],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"management_level\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [\"Senior\"],\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"location\": {\n        \"current\": [],\n        \"past\": [],\n        \"both\": [],\n        \"event\": \"\"\n    },\n    \"company\": {\n        \"current_prompt\": \"Companies specializing in architectural lighting solutions, commercial illumination systems, and smart building technologies\",\n        \"past_prompt\": \"Companies specializing in architectural lighting solutions, commercial illumination systems, and smart building technologies\",\n        \"event\": \"CURRENT OR PAST\"\n    },\n    \"education\": [],\n    \"school\": [],\n    \"current_ownership\": [],\n    \"name\": [],\n    \"ethnicity\": [],\n    \"age\": [],\n    \"total_working_years\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"role_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"company_tenure\": {\"min\": null, \"max\": null},\n    \"skills\": [\n        \"LED lighting\",\n        \"energy-efficient systems\",\n        \"IoT-enabled lighting controls\",\n        \"strategic leadership\",\n        \"operational management\",\n        \"business development\",\n        \"construction\",\n        \"real estate\",\n        \"revenue growth\",\n        \"supply chain optimization\",\n        \"customer experience enhancement\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThis JSON structure includes all the relevant filters derived from the analysis of the solutions and aligns with the original query's requirements, focusing on high-level management roles in specific industries with the desired skill set.",
