The change will result in some layoffs, according to the Verge, which obtained an internal memo written by Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth. “We are doubling down on finding a strong product market fit for wearable Meta AI, building a business around it, and expanding the audience,” Bosworth wrote in the memo. “Our north star to overlay digital content seamlessly onto the physical world remains the same, but the steps on that path just got a lot more exciting.” However, dividing Reality Labs into two distinct sectors appears to be the beginning of a strategy that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg alluded to in April. “Over time, we’ll need to find better ways to articulate the value that’s generated here across both segments so it does not just seem like our hardware costs increase as our glasses ecosystem scales while all the value flows to a different segment,”', 0.07600814851789037)]
