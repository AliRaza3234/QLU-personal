      ", Meta is restructuring Reality Labs by merging all its virtual-reality teams into two divisions one focused on the Quest VR headset line and another group dedicated to the development of other Meta hardware products. The change will result in some layoffs, according to the Verge, which obtained an internal memo written by Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth. \"With Quest 3 bringing into the mainstream, we have finally gotten to a place where we feel like all the major components are in place for us to grow our software platform consistently,\" wrote Bosworth adding that the company is \"deeply committed to investing in Horizon as the core foundation of our social, spatial Horizon OS, and high-quality experiences for both mixed reality and mobile.\" By dividing Reality labs into \"Wearables\" and \"Metaverse,\" led by the company's Vice President of Metaverse Technologies Vishal Shah, Bosworth feels that Meta will be able to create \"more integrated product experiences across hardware, software, and experiences with less friction and fragmentation.\" The decision for Meta to create a dedicated \"Wearables\" department separate from the teams focused on its metaverse gaming and hardware products is partly attributable to its , which Bosworth says are \"a much bigger hit than we anticipated.\" \"We are doubling down on finding a strong product market fit for wearable Meta AI, building a business around it, and expanding the audience,\" Bosworth wrote in the memo. \"Our north star to overlay digital content seamlessly onto the physical world remains the same, but the steps on that path just got a lot more exciting.\" The restructuring, which marks the biggest shakeup of Meta's hardware division since it was renamed Reality Labs during the company's rebranding to a metaverse-focused social media company in 2020, is also likely an attempt to quell investor concerns. Despite and further investment in AI technologies, the billions Meta has sunk into its Quest headsets is still worrisome in regards to the VR hardware's minimal uptick in sales.

On Wednesday, The Information that Apple has \"sharply scaled back its Vision Pro production since the early summer,\" and the company could stop making its existing version by year-end. The reason: few people are buying the $3,500 headset. After a splashy February 2024 launch, interest in the Vision Pro evaporated. Counterpoint Research noted that Vision Pro sales plunged 80% from Q1 to Q2 2024, and the released for the Vision Pro dropped from 300 in February to 89 in March, declining every month since. Supply-chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also in April that Apple had cut its 2024 Vision Pro shipments to 400,000 to 450,000 units, after the company had initially projected to sell 700,000 to 800,000 units or more. Meta, meanwhile, has been crushing the wearable-tech game.

Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, is shaking things up once again. Despite recently announcing significant job cuts, Meta is proving that innovation never sleeps by introducing a new Wearables Unit. Exciting times ahead! Now, I know what you might be thinking: Wait, didn't Meta just lay off a bunch of employees? How can they afford to launch a new division? Well, let me break it down for you. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, explained that the company is undergoing a major reorganization to improve efficiency and focus on key growth areas. And apparently, wearable technology is one of those areas. Zuckerberg believes that wearables will play a crucial role in the future of augmented and virtual reality, which are central to Meta's long-term vision. ## Cutting Jobs to Fuel Innovation So, how does cutting jobs fit into this plan? It's all about strategic allocation of resources. By streamlining certain departments and eliminating redundancies, Meta aims to free up resources that can be invested in new initiatives like the Wearables Unit. It's a bold move, but one that could pay off big time. Just imagine the possibilities: smart glasses that overlay digital information in the real world, fitness trackers that seamlessly integrate with virtual workouts, or even high-tech clothing that adapts to your environment. The potential is endless! ## Learning from the Past Of course, Meta isn't the first tech giant to venture into wearables. Remember Google Glass? While it didn't quite take",

Once expected to revolutionize augmented reality , demand for Apple's high-end Vision Pro headset slumped, leading to a reduction in its production output. According to reports from , Apple has drastically scaled back its production of the wearables market ecosystem of Vision Pro since early summer. The tech giant may cease to make the current model altogether by the end of the year. Launched at $3,500 in February 2024, the early success of Vision Pro quickly cooled off. According to _Counterpoint Research_ , sales of Vision Pro fell by 80% between the first quarter and the second in 2024, while app releases also fell sharply for the headset. Having projected as many as 800,000 units in 2024, Apple reportedly revised that figure to around 400,000 units. ## Success of Meta with the Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Meta's wearable ecosystem is booming, capturing 74% of the headset",

The discussion centered around recent developments from tech giants Meta and Apple, highlighting the potential and challenges of this emerging technology. **Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses: A Step in the Right Direction?** Leo Laporte kicked off the conversation by praising Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which he wore during the podcast. These glasses look like regular eyewear and have been selling well due to their discreet design. Parmy Olson emphasized the importance of aesthetics in wearable tech, noting that Meta's success stems from creating glasses that \"don't look like tech glasses\" and avoid making users \"look nerdy and awful.\" The panel agreed that Meta's approach of starting simple and gradually adding features is a smart strategy. This contrasts with Apple's Vision Pro, which the group perceived as potentially overreaching. **Apple's Vision Pro: Too Much, Too Soon?** The discussion turned critical when Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset was discussed. Leo Laporte expressed skepticism about the $3,500 price point and questioned whether consumers are ready to \"strap a heavy computer on their face.\" Daniel Rubino suggested that Apple might have approached product development from the wrong end, cramming in every imaginable feature instead of starting simple and building up. Parmy Olson noted the peculiarity of Apple's strategy, given that they typically start with a basic product and expand features over time, as they did with the iPhone.

Fitness trackers, smartwatches, wireless headphones These were items that were once fashionable only among a select group of people. Today, however, they have gained mainstream acceptance. And for tech companies, this is a moment of reckoning. Because \"wearables\" isn't just a fringe domain anymore. It's a multi-billion dollar industry rife for disruption. Think about it There was a time when smartphones made all the money. But today, they're just commodities. You can't tell one phone from another. And the market seems to be saturating. But people are only just getting into wearables and that means the growth potential is huge right now. However, one company seems to be dominating everyone else. And it's the usual suspect Apple. Apple is miles ahead of everyone else. So far in the first quarter of 2021, Apple has had a global market share of followed by Samsung which only has an 11% share to its name. Then we have Xiaomi with 9.7%, Huawei with 8.2% and finally, India's BoAt makes an appearance with a respectable 2.9% market share. In fact, some estimates suggest that the wearables segment at Apple alone could be worth a mammoth . If this division was spun off as a different entity, it would feature amongst the Fortune 100 companies. And it's not like this happened overnight. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a result of careful planning and an unparalleled understanding of human psychology. Unlike phones, wearables have to be worn. And people must crave to show them off. It's a style statement, and if you can't fashion something that fits this criterion, then that's a no-go. Apple has nailed this aspect. When Apple introduced the Apple Watch, there was considerable scepticism about the utility of such a product. Some critics even lambasted the first generation for being a let-down. But ask yourself this Why do people wear a wat",

Then Apple started borrowing from Microsoft's playbook: it launched news and games subscriptions, a video streaming service, and even its own credit card. Once Apple moved beyond hardware to software and services, its revenue growth became unstoppable. On January 3, 2022, Apple became the first company ever to surpass $3 trillion in market value, and it is still the world's largest today. ## Market Cap Leaders Change With The Times Today, most of the top 10 companies by market capitalization are technology firms. Until a decade ago, many of the most valuable firms were traditional long-standing blue-chip industrial behemoths like Exxon, Chevron, General Electric or AT&T.

Finance and healthcare are also represented. Berkshire Hathaway leads with a market value of over $1 trillion; Visa and Mastercard make the top 20 with a market cap of about $500 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. healthcare companies UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly, and Denmark's Novo Nordisk are also in the top 20.

I wonder what the average revenue of a unicorn is today, and if that figure is higher or lower than it was a year ago or three years ago. There's a lot of wiggle room in the question; on one hand, the average age of a unicorn has likely gone up, as there are far more born over time than exist in the cohort. At the same time, I'd guess that as unicorn creation accelerates, it leads to companies with less revenue than before making the cut. How does it shake out? I have an email address now, so let me know what you think. Best answer gets a free Diet Coke. Now, to work.

Then Apple started borrowing from Microsoft's playbook: it launched news and games subscriptions, a video streaming service, and even its own credit card. Once Apple moved beyond hardware to software and services, its revenue growth became unstoppable. On January 3, 2022, Apple became the first company ever to surpass $3 trillion in market value, and it is still the world's largest today. ## Market Cap Leaders Change With The Times Today, most of the top 10 companies by market capitalization are technology firms. Until a decade ago, many of the most valuable firms were traditional long-standing blue-chip industrial behemoths like Exxon, Chevron, General Electric or AT&T. This is not to say that traditional sectors have lost all their appeal. Saudi Aramco continues to rank in the top 10, and Exxon, another oil giant, is hanging on in the top 20. Finance and healthcare are also represented. Berkshire Hathaway leads with a market value of over $1 trillion; Visa and Mastercard make the top 20 with a market cap of about $500 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. healthcare companies UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly, and Denmark's Novo Nordisk are also in the top 20.

In fact, Tesla's strategy and its share price particularly after the latter's 700% rise in 2020 are controversial topics in the investor community.

But with a you consider investing. ## Finding a framework Tesla is currently in the high-growth phase of its development as a company.

Taken together, all this means that it's hard to value Tesla today by simply applying a multiple to its current earnings, or else trying to forecast its medium-term cash flows and then discounting them to the present. All those variables are arguably just too volatile right now. A better approach may be to ask the following question: what will Tesla's stabilized earnings look like _after_ its growth phase in, say, 2030? That's the path we're going to take in this Pack. Based on various well-educated assumptions, we'll attempt to forecast Tesla's financial position in 2030 in terms of both revenue and profit and use this to value Tesla's future stock. We can then discount this valuation back to the present to see what the company's shares should be worth today. We can also calculate the average annualized return investors can expect given the difference between Tesla's actual stock price at present and the theoretical \"fair value\" per share in 2030. But before we get to that, let's kick things into gear by investigating what Tesla's future revenue mig",

      "( ( ( > ( > Amazon Vs. Walmart: Revenue And Profit Comparison, 20102024 Walmart is the largest US retailer overall, while Amazon dominates online retail. Over the past several years, Amazon's revenue growth has significantly outpaced Walmart's, and its profits have also surged. To understand the factors behind these trends, we analyzed their revenues and profits across business segments, geographic regions, and product/service categories. **NOTE:** For our analysis, we examined the most recent annual financials of both companies. Amazon's fiscal year ends in December, meaning its 2023 revenues represent the 12 months ending on December 31, 2023. Walmart's fiscal year ends in January, so its FY24 revenues correspond to the 12 months ending on January 31, 2024. Since 11 of those 12 months fall within 2023, we compared Walmart's FY24 revenues with Amazon's 2023 revenues. Following are three select insights from our analysis: 1. **Amazon's growth far outpaces Walmart and the retail sector.** Amazon annual revenues reached $575 billion in 2023, and Walmart total revenues reached $648 billion. Over the last five years , Amazon achieved a cumulative annual growth rate of 20%, significantly outpacing both Walmart's 5% growth and the 7% growth in total US retail sales . Extending the analysis to a 13-year period , Amazon's CAGR stood at an impressive 24%, compared to 3% for Walmart and 5% for the broader US retail industry. **In Q4 2024, Amazon's quarterly revenues could surpass Walmart's for the first time.** For context, in Q1 2010, Amazon's quarterly revenues were a modest $7 billion compared to Walmart's $100 billion. Over the next decade, however, Amazon experienced rapid growth, fueled by its expansion into new markets and services. In Q4 2024, consensus estimates project Amazon's quarterly revenues to reach $186 billion, narrowly surpassing Walmart's expected $180 billion . !( 1. **Amazon widens the net income gap with Walmart.** Amazon continues to",

The company formally changed its name in 1924 and has since grown into ( focused on software, technology and business consulting, and cloud computing.1 IBM generated net income of $7.5 billion on revenue of $61.9 billion in 2023. It has a market capitalization of $166.9 billion as of April 2024.

      "* ( * ( Close Exxon Mobil Corp. (( one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, traces its origins to an oil-refining business started by John D. Rockefeller, Maurice B. Clark, and Samuel Andrews in 1863 in Cleveland, Ohio. The business first incorporated as the Standard Oil Co. in Ohio in 1870, and by 1880 had grown into an oil empire controlling between 90% and 95% of all oil produced in the U.S. Despite a court order to dissolve in 1892, the company, which had been combined into a trust, maintained its power and operations. The trust shifted its headquarters to New York City and later incorporated as a holding company in New Jersey in 1899. But in 1911, the U.S. government ordered the company to divest its major holdings. One of those holdings was the Standard Oil Company of New York, which eventually became Mobil Oil Corporation in 1966. Another was the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which was renamed Exxon Corporation in 1972. The two companies merged in 1999 to become Exxon Mobil Corporation",

      "( # WARNER LAMBERT. # 2000: Pfizer joins forces with Warner-Lambert In 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert, bringing together two of the fastest-growing companies in the pharmaceutical industry and adding to Pfizer's global strengths and rich heritage. With Warner-Lambert, Pfizer gained product lines ranging from Parke-Davis branded pharmaceuticals to Listerine mouthwash to Schick and Wilkinson Sword wet-shave products. ### Warner-Lambert: A History Like Pfizer, Warner-Lambert traces its history back to the mid-1800s, the opportune days of a growing America. In 1856, William R. Warner launched his own drug store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An innovator at heart, he invented a tablet-coating process to encase harsh-tasting medicines in sugar shells. This innovation earned Warner a place in the Smithsonian Institution. Warner gave up his retail shop in 1886. He then focused solely on drug manufacturing under the name William R. Warner & Co. Meanwhile, in the American midwest, Jordan Wheat Lambert was launching Lambert Pharmacal company in St. Louis. Lambert's main product was Listerine antiseptic, and it was marketed only to medical professionals. Lambert soon realized that Listerine had huge consu",
      "usly hold stakes in more than one large pharmaceutical company and their generic counterparts, something known as \"common ownership\". This has raised concern that it undermines competition and as a result consumers end up paying more. A recent co-authored by researchers Albert Banal-Estanol, Melissa Newham and Jo Seldeslachts for DIW Berlin found that large pharmaceutical companies have become connected to each other through their shareholders. \"Public companies are increasingly owned by a handful of large institutional investors so we expected to see many ownership links between companies what was more surprising was the magnitude of common ownership,\" the authors told _TRT World_ in an emailed response. \"We frequently find that more than 50 percent of a company is owned by 'common' shareholders who also own stakes in rival pharma companies.\" For instance in 2014, the same investors collectively owned half the shares of Switzerland-based Novartis and Germany's Bayer, the maker of Aspirin. TRTWorld Things haven't changed much since then. The three largest shareholders of Pfizer, J&J and Merck are Vanguard, SSGA and BlackRock, the multi-trillion dollar funds which make investments on behalf of their clients and keep a cut for their service. What institutional investors do is perfectly legal. They are not even reviewed by competition authorities as long as an investor such as BlackRock keeps its shareholding at less than 10 percent in a pharma firm. They are classified as passive investors. \"The concern is how passive are they?\" the DIW Berlin report authors said. Institutional investors may not directly interfere in a pharma company's day-to-day business. But knowing who the shareholders are and their stake in rival companies, the pharma executives can end up working in the interest of common institutional investors, they said. \"The increase in connectivity between brand firms may also affect drug prices. This is because economic theory clearly indicates that intense price competition between firms that share the same owner, ultimately reduces the profits of the common owner.\" Institutional investors having a stake in multip",
