The reason: few people are buying the $3,500 headset. After a splashy February 2024 launch, interest in the Vision Pro evaporated.

Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, is shaking things up once again. Despite recently announcing significant job cuts, Meta is proving that innovation never sleeps by introducing a new Wearables Unit. Exciting times ahead! Now, I know what you might be thinking: Wait, didn't Meta just lay off a bunch of employees? How can they afford to launch a new division? Well, let me break it down for you. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, explained that the company is undergoing a major reorganization to improve efficiency and focus on key growth areas. And apparently, wearable technology is one of those areas. Zuckerberg believes that wearables will play a crucial role in the future of augmented and virtual reality, which are central to Meta's long-term vision. ## Cutting Jobs to Fuel Innovation So, how does cutting jobs fit into this plan? It's all about strategic allocation of resources. By streamlining certain departments and eliminating redundancies, Meta aims to free up resources that can be invested in new initiatives like the Wearables Unit. It's a bold move, but one that could pay off big time. Just imagine the possibilities: smart glasses that overlay digital information in the real world, fitness trackers that seamlessly integrate with virtual workouts, or even high-tech clothing that adapts to your environment. The potential is endless! ## Learning from the Past Of course, Meta isn't the first tech giant to venture into wearables. Remember Google Glass? While it didn't quite take\",\n",

These glasses look like regular eyewear and have been selling well due to their discreet design.

Leo Laporte expressed skepticism about the $3,500 price point and questioned whether consumers are ready to \"strap a heavy computer on their face.\" Daniel Rubino suggested that Apple might have approached product development from the wrong end, cramming in every imaginable feature instead of starting simple and building up.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is a result of careful planning and an unparalleled understanding of human psychology. Unlike phones, wearables have to be worn. And people must crave to show them off. It\\'s a style statement, and if you can\\'t fashion something that fits this criterion, then that\\'s a no-go. Apple has nailed this aspect. When Apple introduced the Apple Watch, there was considerable scepticism about the utility of such a product. Some critics even lambasted the first generation for being a let-down.

Finance and healthcare are also represented. Berkshire Hathaway leads with a market value of over $1 trillion; Visa and Mastercard make the top 20 with a market cap of about $500 billion.

I wonder what the average revenue of a unicorn is today, and if that figure is higher or lower than it was a year ago or three years ago. There's a lot of wiggle room in the question; on one hand, the average age of a unicorn has likely gone up, as there are far more born over time than exist in the cohort. At the same time, I'd guess that as unicorn creation accelerates, it leads to companies with less revenue than before making the cut. How does it shake out? I have an email address now, so let me know what you think. Best answer gets a free Diet Coke. Now, to work.

On January 3, 2022, Apple became the first company ever to surpass $3 trillion in market value, and it is still the world's largest today. ## Market Cap Leaders Change With The Times Today, most of the top 10 companies by market capitalization are technology firms. Until a decade ago, many of the most valuable firms were traditional long-standing blue-chip industrial behemoths like Exxon, Chevron, General Electric or AT&T. This is not to say that traditional sectors have lost all their appeal. Saudi Aramco continues to rank in the top 10, and Exxon, another oil giant, is hanging on in the top 20. Finance and healthcare are also represented. Berkshire Hathaway leads with a market value of over $1 trillion; Visa and Mastercard make the top 20 with a market cap of about $500 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. healthcare companies UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly, and Denmark's Novo Nordisk are also in the top 20.

The company, which historically has been unable to keep up with demand, has seen its order backlog shrink from **476,000** units in July 2022, to **74,000** in December 2022. This has been attributed to Tesla\\'s robust production growth, which saw 2022 production increase **41%** over 2021 .

Over the past several years, Amazon's revenue growth has significantly outpaced Walmart's, and its profits have also surged. To understand the factors behind these trends, we analyzed their revenues and profits across business segments, geographic regions, and product/service categories. **NOTE:** For our analysis, we examined the most recent annual financials of both companies. Amazon's fiscal year ends in December, meaning its 2023 revenues represent the 12 months ending on December 31, 2023. Walmart's fiscal year ends in January, so its FY24 revenues correspond to the 12 months ending on January 31, 2024. Since 11 of those 12 months fall within 2023, we compared Walmart's FY24 revenues with Amazon's 2023 revenues. Following are three select insights from our analysis: 1. **Amazon's growth far outpaces Walmart and the retail sector.** Amazon annual revenues reached $575 billion in 2023, and Walmart total revenues reached $648 billion. Over the last five years , Amazon achieved a cumulative annual growth rate of 20%, significantly outpacing both Walmart's 5% growth and the 7% growth in total US retail sales . Extending the analysis to a 13-year period , Amazon's CAGR stood at an impressive 24%, compared to 3% for Walmart and 5% for the broader US retail industry. **In Q4 2024, Amazon's quarterly revenues could surpass Walmart's for the first time.** For context, in Q1 2010, Amazon's quarterly revenues were a modest $7 billion compared to Walmart's $100 billion. Over the next decade, however, Amazon experienced rapid growth, fueled by its expansion into new markets and services. In Q4 2024, consensus estimates project Amazon's quarterly revenues to reach $186 billion, narrowly surpassing Walmart's expected $180 billion . !( 1. **Amazon widens the net income gap with Walmart.** Amazon continues to\",\n",

Clark, and Samuel Andrews in 1863 in Cleveland, Ohio. The business first incorporated as the Standard Oil Co. in Ohio in 1870, and by 1880 had grown into an oil empire controlling between 90% and 95% of all oil produced in the U.S. Despite a court order to dissolve in 1892, the company, which had been combined into a trust, maintained its power and operations. The trust shifted its headquarters to New York City and later incorporated as a holding company in New Jersey in 1899. But in 1911, the U.S. government ordered the company to divest its major holdings. One of those holdings was the Standard Oil Company of New York, which eventually became Mobil Oil Corporation in 1966. Another was the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which was renamed Exxon Corporation in 1972. The two companies merged in 1999 to become Exxon Mobil Corporation\",\n",

With Warner-Lambert, Pfizer gained product lines ranging from Parke-Davis branded pharmaceuticals to Listerine mouthwash to Schick and Wilkinson Sword wet-shave products. ### Warner-Lambert: A History Like Pfizer, Warner-Lambert traces its history back to the mid-1800s, the opportune days of a growing America. In 1856, William R. Warner launched his own drug store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An innovator at heart, he invented a tablet-coating process to encase harsh-tasting medicines in sugar shells. This innovation earned Warner a place in the Smithsonian Institution. Warner gave up his retail shop in 1886. He then focused solely on drug manufacturing under the name William R. Warner & Co. Meanwhile, in the American midwest, Jordan Wheat Lambert was launching Lambert Pharmacal company in St. Louis.

       "   'usly hold stakes in more than one large pharmaceutical company and their generic counterparts, something known as \"common ownership\". This has raised concern that it undermines competition and as a result consumers end up paying more. A recent co-authored by researchers Albert Banal-Estanol, Melissa Newham and Jo Seldeslachts for DIW Berlin found that large pharmaceutical companies have become connected to each other through their shareholders. \"Public companies are increasingly owned by a handful of large institutional investors so we expected to see many ownership links between companies what was more surprising was the magnitude of common ownership,\" the authors told _TRT World_ in an emailed response. \"We frequently find that more than 50 percent of a company is owned by \\'common\\' shareholders who also own stakes in rival pharma companies.\" For instance in 2014, the same investors collectively owned half the shares of Switzerland-based Novartis and Germany\\'s Bayer, the maker of Aspirin. TRTWorld Things haven\\'t changed much since then. The three largest shareholders of Pfizer, J&J and Merck are Vanguard, SSGA and BlackRock, the multi-trillion dollar funds which make investments on behalf of their clients and keep a cut for their service. What institutional investors do is perfectly legal. They are not even reviewed by competition authorities as long as an investor such as BlackRock keeps its shareholding at less than 10 percent in a pharma firm. They are classified as passive investors. \"The concern is how passive are they?\" the DIW Berlin report authors said. Institutional investors may not directly interfere in a pharma company\\'s day-to-day business. But knowing who the shareholders are and their stake in rival companies, the pharma executives can end up working in the interest of common institutional investors, they said. \"The increase in connectivity between brand firms may also affect drug prices. This is because economic theory clearly indicates that intense price competition between firms that share the same owner, ultimately reduces the profits of the common owner.\" Institutional investors having a stake in multip',\n",

Social media is a collective term for any digital tool that allows people to quickly communicate and interact, share content, and collaborate. People use social media to stay in touch and interact with friends, family and various communities. It encompasses a wide range of websites and apps. Some, like Twitter, specialize in sharing links and short written messages. Others, like Instagram and TikTok, are built to primarily share photos and videos. ## The four main categories of social media platforms for hotels: There are four main categories of social media platforms that are relevant to the hotel industry at present, though these categories shift and change rapidly much like the platforms that are contained within them: ### 1. Social networks Most of us will be familiar with social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn . People use these networks to connect with one another and share information, thoughts, and ideas. The focus of these networks is usually on the user.

So how can social networking sites help your hotel? * Reach potential hotel guests through content and ads: By their very nature, these platforms cultivate large, diverse communities. Your hotel can look to gain an audience with these communities through growing your profile and posting regular content, as well as through paid advertisements.

Despite recently announcing significant job cuts, Meta is proving that innovation never sleeps by introducing a new Wearables Unit. Exciting times ahead! Now, I know what you might be thinking: Wait, didn't Meta just lay off a bunch of employees? How can they afford to launch a new division? Well, let me break it down for you. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, explained that the company is undergoing a major reorganization to improve efficiency and focus on key growth areas. And apparently, wearable technology is one of those areas. Zuckerberg believes that wearables will play a crucial role in the future of augmented and virtual reality, which are central to Meta's long-term vision. ## Cutting Jobs to Fuel Innovation So, how does cutting jobs fit into this plan? It's all about strategic allocation of resources. By streamlining certain departments and eliminating redundancies, Meta aims to free up resources that can be invested in new initiatives like the Wearables Unit. It's a bold move, but one that could pay off big time. Just imagine the possibilities: smart glasses that overlay digital information in the real world, fitness trackers that seamlessly integrate with virtual workouts, or even high-tech clothing that adapts to your environment.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is a result of careful planning and an unparalleled understanding of human psychology. Unlike phones, wearables have to be worn. And people must crave to show them off. It\\'s a style statement, and if you can\\'t fashion something that fits this criterion, then that\\'s a no-go. Apple has nailed this aspect. When Apple introduced the Apple Watch, there was considerable scepticism about the utility of such a product. Some critics even lambasted the first generation for being a let-down.

I wonder what the average revenue of a unicorn is today, and if that figure is higher or lower than it was a year ago or three years ago. There's a lot of wiggle room in the question; on one hand, the average age of a unicorn has likely gone up, as there are far more born over time than exist in the cohort. At the same time, I'd guess that as unicorn creation accelerates, it leads to companies with less revenue than before making the cut. How does it shake out? I have an email address now, so let me know what you think. Best answer gets a free Diet Coke. Now, to work. Today we're chatting about a revenue threshold that's a pretty good demarcator for what a unicorn should be: rare, valuable and fundamentally desirable. $100 million Back when the unicorn phras) six years ago, it excluded a collection of startups that were special in their own right.

Our annual Best Under A Billion list of 200 small and midsized publicly traded companies, with sales under $1 billion, bears testimony to that economic resilience. A flourishing middle class willing to splurge on meals out and the steady return of tourists put 21 food and beverage companies among the top performers, more than double from last year. The rebound in consumer spending also contributed to a renewed glow in the beauty business, with nine related companies making the cut.

       "   \"( ( ( > ( > Amazon Vs. Walmart: Revenue And Profit Comparison, 20102024 Walmart is the largest US retailer overall, while Amazon dominates online retail. Over the past several years, Amazon's revenue growth has significantly outpaced Walmart's, and its profits have also surged. To understand the factors behind these trends, we analyzed their revenues and profits across business segments, geographic regions, and product/service categories. **NOTE:** For our analysis, we examined the most recent annual financials of both companies. Amazon's fiscal year ends in December, meaning its 2023 revenues represent the 12 months ending on December 31, 2023. Walmart's fiscal year ends in January, so its FY24 revenues correspond to the 12 months ending on January 31, 2024. Since 11 of those 12 months fall within 2023, we compared Walmart's FY24 revenues with Amazon's 2023 revenues. Following are three select insights from our analysis: 1. **Amazon's growth far outpaces Walmart and the retail sector.** Amazon annual revenues reached $575 billion in 2023, and Walmart total revenues reached $648 billion. Over the last five years , Amazon achieved a cumulative annual growth rate of 20%, significantly outpacing both Walmart's 5% growth and the 7% growth in total US retail sales . Extending the analysis to a 13-year period , Amazon's CAGR stood at an impressive 24%, compared to 3% for Walmart and 5% for the broader US retail industry. **In Q4 2024, Amazon's quarterly revenues could surpass Walmart's for the first time.** For context, in Q1 2010, Amazon's quarterly revenues were a modest $7 billion compared to Walmart's $100 billion. Over the next decade, however, Amazon experienced rapid growth, fueled by its expansion into new markets and services. In Q4 2024, consensus estimates project Amazon's quarterly revenues to reach $186 billion, narrowly surpassing Walmart's expected $180 billion . !( 1. **Amazon widens the net income gap with Walmart.** Amazon continues to\",\n",

Clark, and Samuel Andrews in 1863 in Cleveland, Ohio. The business first incorporated as the Standard Oil Co. in Ohio in 1870, and by 1880 had grown into an oil empire controlling between 90% and 95% of all oil produced in the U.S. Despite a court order to dissolve in 1892, the company, which had been combined into a trust, maintained its power and operations. The trust shifted its headquarters to New York City and later incorporated as a holding company in New Jersey in 1899. But in 1911, the U.S. government ordered the company to divest its major holdings. One of those holdings was the Standard Oil Company of New York, which eventually became Mobil Oil Corporation in 1966. Another was the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which was renamed Exxon Corporation in 1972. The two companies merged in 1999 to become Exxon Mobil Corporation\",\n",

Generally, when a consumer visits a publisher's website or app, its publisher side services send out a request to many advertisers through their advertiser-side services, asking for bids from advertisers who would like to show an ad to the consumer.

The Internet was a novelty. We accessed the web on dial-up modems, surfed pages using Netscape and searched for information on Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos. Around the same time, across the Pacific, Amazon had only just launched an obscure online bookstore. In 1995, I began my career as a journalist at in Adelaide. The web was so niche that there were fevered debates about whether we would need one \"Internet terminal,\" or perhaps two, for an entire newsroom.

       "   'usly hold stakes in more than one large pharmaceutical company and their generic counterparts, something known as \"common ownership\". This has raised concern that it undermines competition and as a result consumers end up paying more. A recent co-authored by researchers Albert Banal-Estanol, Melissa Newham and Jo Seldeslachts for DIW Berlin found that large pharmaceutical companies have become connected to each other through their shareholders. \"Public companies are increasingly owned by a handful of large institutional investors so we expected to see many ownership links between companies what was more surprising was the magnitude of common ownership,\" the authors told _TRT World_ in an emailed response. \"We frequently find that more than 50 percent of a company is owned by \\'common\\' shareholders who also own stakes in rival pharma companies.\" For instance in 2014, the same investors collectively owned half the shares of Switzerland-based Novartis and Germany\\'s Bayer, the maker of Aspirin. TRTWorld Things haven\\'t changed much since then. The three largest shareholders of Pfizer, J&J and Merck are Vanguard, SSGA and BlackRock, the multi-trillion dollar funds which make investments on behalf of their clients and keep a cut for their service. What institutional investors do is perfectly legal. They are not even reviewed by competition authorities as long as an investor such as BlackRock keeps its shareholding at less than 10 percent in a pharma firm. They are classified as passive investors. \"The concern is how passive are they?\" the DIW Berlin report authors said. Institutional investors may not directly interfere in a pharma company\\'s day-to-day business. But knowing who the shareholders are and their stake in rival companies, the pharma executives can end up working in the interest of common institutional investors, they said. \"The increase in connectivity between brand firms may also affect drug prices. This is because economic theory clearly indicates that intense price competition between firms that share the same owner, ultimately reduces the profits of the common owner.\" Institutional investors having a stake in multip',\n",

Our annual Best Under A Billion list of 200 small and midsized publicly traded companies, with sales under $1 billion, bears testimony to that economic resilience. A flourishing middle class willing to splurge on meals out and the steady return of tourists put 21 food and beverage companies among the top performers, more than double from last year. The rebound in consumer spending also contributed to a renewed glow in the beauty business, with nine related companies making the cut. Meanwhile easing supply constraints saw the number of semiconductor firms, last year's standout sector, fall to eight from 14. The 2024 list includes 54 returnees from the previous year.

On January 3, 2022, Apple became the first company ever to surpass $3 trillion in market value, and it is still the world's largest today. ## Market Cap Leaders Change With The Times Today, most of the top 10 companies by market capitalization are technology firms. Until a decade ago, many of the most valuable firms were traditional long-standing blue-chip industrial behemoths like Exxon, Chevron, General Electric or AT&T. This is not to say that traditional sectors have lost all their appeal. Saudi Aramco continues to rank in the top 10, and Exxon, another oil giant, is hanging on in the top 20. Finance and healthcare are also represented. Berkshire Hathaway leads with a market value of over $1 trillion; Visa and Mastercard make the top 20 with a market cap of about $500 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. healthcare companies UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly, and Denmark's Novo Nordisk are also in the top 20. Yet, more often than not, the biggest companies by stock market valuation tend to be tech firms, even if they make things or sell things not only that, rather than being a one-time purchase, these physical objects can often continue to generate steady and predictable revenue streams over long periods of time. Tesla, for example, has monthly fees for its autopilot and self-driving features, as well as for its premium connectivity package; Amazon offers all kinds of subscriptions and premium subscriptions linked to its Alexa, Fire TV, and Kindle devices. ## **Today's Headlines vs. Strong Fundamentals** Successful strategy aside, the total dollar value of a company's outstanding shares can be affected by a myriad of other unpredictable factors. It was not too long ago that a contr\", \"unch. It's lovely to be back, and I'm excited to chat about what's going on with private companies, public markets and the space between the two. I wonder what the average revenue of a unicorn is today, and if that figure is higher or lower than it was a year ago or three years ago. There's a lot of wiggle room in the question; on one hand, the average age of a unicorn has likely gone up, as there are far more born over time than exist in the cohort. At the same time, I'd guess that as unicorn creation accelerates, it leads to companies with less revenue than before making the cut. How does it shake out? I have an email address now, so let me know what you think. Best answer gets a free Diet Coke. Now, to work. Today we're chatting about a revenue threshold that's a pretty good demarcator for what a unicorn should be: rare, valuable and fundamentally desirable. $100 million Back when the unicorn phras) six years ago, it excluded a collection of startups that were special in their own right.

Our annual Best Under A Billion list of 200 small and midsized publicly traded companies, with sales under $1 billion, bears testimony to that economic resilience. A flourishing middle class willing to splurge on meals out and the steady return of tourists put 21 food and beverage companies among the top performers, more than double from last year. The rebound in consumer spending also contributed to a renewed glow in the beauty business, with nine related companies making the cut.

       "  'content': [\"Find out what happened in the markets today – and why you should care – with the free Daily Brief newsletter. In the eighteen years since it was founded in 2003 by a small group of engineers, America’sTeslahas gone from underdog champion of niche electric vehicle (EV) design to market leader in one of tomorrow’s most exciting technologies. The company released its first EV, theTesla Roadster, in 2008. The car’s launch attracted considerable fanfare: its range, acceleration, and top speed were all unprecedented for a mass-produced EV at the time. Fast forward to 2021 and Tesla, now offering four different models and counting, is the world’s biggest-selling EV brand. The company delivered around half a million EVs last year: six times more than in 2016, withrevenuerising more than 300% across that four-year period. Leveraging its expertise in producing the batteries that power its EVs, Tesla today also has a growing energy storage business. These battery systems – essentially shipping containers full of power cells – are increasingly being used to help electricity grids cope with wind and solar power’s naturally fluctuating supply. Tesla’s energy storage deployments were up more than 80% last year, while 2021 should see the company complete construction of the world’slargestbattery facility. Nevertheless, Tesla’s EV arm remains – for now – the firm’s most important driver of revenue andprofit, which is why investors remain obsessed with metrics like quarterly vehicle deliveries. In fact, Tesla’s strategy and its share price – particularly after the latter’s 700% rise in 2020 – are controversial topics in the investor community. On top of CEO (sorry, “Technoking”) Elon Musk’s oftenerraticbehavior, the company’s $1.5 billioninvestmentin bitcoin earlier this year raised a fair few eyebrows. But with astockmarket value more than100 timeshigher than 2021’s projected profit, the most important questions arguably relate to the appropriateness of Tesla’s valuation. The purpose of this Pack is therefore to present you with a professional-style framework you can use to value Tesla’s stock for yourself – allowing you to get properly informed before (or even after) you consider investing. Tesla is currently in the high-growth phase of its development as a company. That means profit and profitability are generally growing, albeit erratically. Tesla’s cash flow is also all over the place as it spends heavily on building new factories and increasing production – and shortfalls often have to be plugged by freshsalesof shares or debt, both of which impact the company’s per-share valuation. Taken together, all this means that it’s hard to value Tesla today by simply applying a multiple to its current earnings, or else trying to forecast its medium-term cash flows and then discounting them to the present. All those variables are arguably just too volatile right now. A better approach may be to ask the following question: what will Tesla’s stabilized earnings look likeafterits growth phase – in, say, 2030? That’s the path we’re going to take in this Pack. Based on various well-educated assumptions, we’ll attempt to forecast Tesla’s financial position in 2030 in terms of both revenue and profit and use this to value Tesla’s future stock. We can then discount this valuation back to the present to see what the company’s shares should be worth today. We can also calculate the average annualized return investors can expect given the difference between Tesla’s actual stock price at present and the theoretical “fair value” per share in 2030. But before we get to that, let’s kick things into gear by investigating what Tesla’s future revenue might look like. Tesla generated $31.5 billion of revenue in 2020. The bulk of that – $25.7 billion, to be precise – came from selling cars and related services such as internet connectivity, over-the-air software updates, and access to the company’s EV charging network. The remainder came from regulatory credit sales, repair and maintenance services, and the company’s energy storage business. We’ll touch on these in a bit – but for now, let’s focus on forecasting the biggest driver of Tesla’s revenue: auto sales. This involves estimating two key figures: thenumber of cars sold(or, given Tesla’s previously notorious production backlog, delivered), and theaverage selling price(ASP)per car. You can see the relevant data for the last five years shown below. Tesla delivered half a million cars in 2020, representing an impressivecompound annual growth rate (CAGR)of 60% since 2016. And the company’s ambition is to maintain a similarly strong average growth rate of 50% over the medium term, according to its latest shareholder deck. Tesla should be able to keep expanding production capacity thanks to a recently opened Shanghai plant as well as forthcoming factories in both Berlin and Texas. In terms of forecasting Tesla’s vehiclesalesin 2030, a top-down approach is probably our best bet: first looking at total projected global EV sales for 2030, and then multiplying that by Tesla’s estimated future market share. Accordingto research providerBloomberg New Energy Finance(BNEF), 1.7 million EVs were sold worldwide in 2020. (Note that this only includes the battery electric vehicles Tesla sells and not plug-in hybrids.) Tesla’s 500,000 vehicle deliveries therefore accounted for around 30% of the global EV market last year. BNEF predicts annual global EV sales will hit 26 million by 2030. But it’s unrealistic to expect Tesla to maintain a 30% market share in the face of rising competition from traditional automakers likeVolkswagen,Hyundai,BMW, and theRenault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, as well as Chinese upstarts such asNIO,Xpeng, andLi Auto. If we assume that Tesla’s market share accordingly drops to 20%, then that would represent 20% x 26 million = 5.2 million vehicle sales in 2030. Feel free to make your own educated assumptions here, of course – this is all a matter of conjecture. Time for a sense check: 5.2 million Tesla vehicle sales in 2030 would represent a 26% CAGR over the next decade. That matches up pretty well with the company’s ambitions to grow vehicle deliveries at a 50% CAGR over the next few years. You’d then naturally expect that rate to drop off in the second half of this decade: it’s much harder to maintain a high growth rate as the numbers get bigger. By way of comparison, investment bankMorgan StanleyexpectsTesla’s 2030 deliveries to sit at 5.4 million, while investment firmWedbush SecuritiespredictsTesla will approach 5 million annual deliveries by the end of the decade. Some analysts are even more optimistic:ARK Investment Managementexpects Tesla’s vehicle deliveries in2025to hit 5 million at worst, and a whopping 10 million in the best-case scenario. So what about the average selling price for the company’s EVs? This has been decreasing lately due to what’s known as the “mix effect”: as shown below, an increasing proportion of Tesla’s sales are of cheaper vehicles such as theModel 3andModel Y(prices starting at $37,000 and $49,000 respectively). In 2020, the company’s ASP was $51,400. As shown below, however, research from consultancyOliver WymansuggestsEVcostswill fall by around a fifth over the next decade. If we assume that the competitive EV market reflects this in vehicle prices, and that the mix effect at Tesla continues on its present course, then the company’s ASP could well fall 25% to reach $38,500 in 2030. Once again, feel free to use your own assumptions. Intuitively, however, Tesla’s ASP will have to decline in order for it to access greater levels of EV demand. If Tesla is going to sell 5.2 million vehicles annually by 2030, the average car will probably have to have a more affordable price tag attached. 5.2 million vehicles at an ASP of $38,500 would give Tesla $200.3 billion ofautorevenuein 2030. We can safely assume revenue from selling regulatory credits will be zero: these are due to be phased out. The company’s revenue from repair and maintenance services, meanwhile, averaged 10% of auto revenue over the past four years. Keeping that percentage flat, 10% x $200 billion = $20 billion of additional revenue from selling services in 2030. Finally, and significantly, Tesla generated almost $2 billion of revenue from selling battery energy storage systems in 2020. This business is expected to be a big part of Tesla’s future: in fact, CEO Muskthinksit could eventually contribute at least as much revenue as EVsales. As wind and solar power come to represent a greater portion of more countries’ generation capacities, efficient battery storage will become critical to the effective management of electricity grids. The chart below shows consultancyWood Mackenzie’spredictions for global energy storage capacity increases over the next decade: itexpectsa 31% compound annual growth rate. For Tesla, let’s assume that 2020’s $2 billion energy storage revenue will rise at a 20% CAGR to hit $12.3 billion in 2030. This involves partially offsetting Wood Mackenzie’s capacity forecasts against expectations for falling battery storage prices, which will likely reduce Tesla’s revenue per unit of battery storage sold. As ever, you may want to use your own assumptions. Putting all the above together gives us a total Tesla 2030revenueforecast of $232.7 billion, summarized in the table below. Note that the cells in yellow represent where we’ve inserted assumptions that you can play around with further. More specifically, we’re forecastingEBITDA: earnings beforeinterest, taxes, and non-cash expenses such as depreciation andamortization. EBITDA essentially calculates a company’s operatingprofitbefore factoring in the impacts of various financing and accounting decisions. It’s very common to value companies based on some multiple of EBITDA – so this is the metric we’re going to focus on in this Pack. The simplest way to calculate Tesla’s future EBITDA would be to multiply ourrevenueforecast by some assumedmarginpercentage indicating how many cents of EBITDA the firm makes for each dollar ofsales. Tesla’s EBITDA margin in 2020 was 18.4% – but that overstates how much profit the company is generating from its core businesses. That’s because Tesla’s 2020 EBITDA includes $1.6 billion of revenue from selling regulatory credits, a source of cash that will likely soon disappear. Stripping this out gives us a purer EBITDA margin of 13.4% in 2020. That’s still an impressive number. Japanese automakerToyotahas some of the highest profit margins in the old-school industry, and its 2020 EBITDA margin stood at 13.2%. Tesla is fortunate in that it generates some sales from extremely high-margin services such as software upgrades: in the screenshot below, for example, you can see Tesla’s online store offers the option of a $10,000 self-driving top-up at checkout. Play around with your own precognitions here, but we’ll assume Tesla’sEBITDAmarginwill expand by ten percentage points to hit 23.4% in 2030, driven by two main factors. First, Tesla should benefit from an increased manufacturing scale lowering the cost of its EV production. Second, technological developments mean the company may well sell more high-margin software products to its customers. As a sense check, we can draw an analogy withApple, which first sellsiPhonesand then sells software and services to iPhone users. Apple’s EBITDA margin is around 30%. Multiplying our 2030revenueforecast of $232.7 billion by our 23.4% EBITDA margin gives us a 2030 Tesla EBITDA estimate of $54.5 billion. Now we’ve forecasted Tesla’s 2030 EBITDA, we can value the entire company by applying a commonly used valuation multiple calledEV/EBITDA– or enterprise-value-to-EBITDA.Enterprise value(not to be confused with electric vehicles) is the value of a company’s outstanding shares plus its “net debt” – total debt minus cash holdings. Enterprise value is essentially what someone would have to pay to buy the entire company. So what EV/EBITDA multiple should we use when valuing Tesla? A common approach to making that decision involves seeing what multiples similar companies are trading at. Tesla in 2030 will probably be a hybrid between an automaker and a tech company with a powerful premium brand – and as alluded to previously, Tesla’s mixture of hardware and software specialties means it may find a close analogue in tech giant Apple. As the table below shows, the average EV/EBITDA of the world’s 10 largest automakers stood at 11.7x at the time of writing. Apple’s multiple meanwhile stood at 23.5x. Averaging the two gives us 17.6x – and applying that to our 2030 EBITDA estimate of $54.5 billion yields a forecasted 2030 enterprise value for Tesla of $960 billion. Because enterprise value is the value of a company’s outstanding shares plus its net debt, we need to subtract Tesla’s forecasted net debt in 2030 to arrive at a purestockvaluation. As of the time of writing, Tesla’s net debt is actually negative: it’s got more cash on its balance sheet than borrowings. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll assume net debt is zero in 2030 as Tesla spends some of its current cash and/or issues more debt to fund its expansion over the next decade. If Tesla’s forecasted 2030 enterprise value of $960 billion is also its total stock value, then we can divide that by the number of shares outstanding (960 million at the time of writing) to arrive at a nice, round valuation of $1,000 per share in 2030. You can interpret the present-day significance of this in two different ways. One involves discounting the valuation and comparing the result to Tesla’sstockprice today. Discounting $1,000 in nine years’ time at 10% per year, for example, gives you a $424 per share value today – whereas Tesla is actually trading for around $675. Alternatively, you can calculate how much you’d make investing in Tesla shares at today’s prices and watching them rise to that $1,000 level in 2030: a 4.5% compounded annual return. Whether you think these assumptions are fair and accurate – or whether you think Tesla has more upside to gain from, say, launching a fully autonomous taxi network – is outside the scope of this Pack. The main point is that you’ve now got a framework that you can use and play around with to arrive at your very own valuation for Tesla. You can download our model’s Excel fileherein order to explore things further. Adjusting its variables based on different assumptions will help you think more deeply about Tesla’s future – allowing you to weigh in on the company’s great valuation debate and invest (or not, as the case may be) with greater confidence. Arise, Technoking… 🔹 Tesla designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles – but it’s also increasingly getting into battery energy storage systems. 🔹 Since Tesla is currently in a high-growth phase with erratic profitability, valuation attempts should first begin by forecasting its future, stabilized financials. 🔹 To forecast the company's 2030revenue, we're assuming that it makes 20% of the 26 million projected global EVsalesthat year and that their ASP is 25% lower than in 2020. 🔹 We’re assuming Tesla’sEBITDAmarginwill meanwhile expand to 23.4% as it benefits from increased manufacturing scale and more higher-margin software sales. 🔹 Applying a 17.6x EV/EBITDA multiple (arrived at by averaging large automakers' and Apple's current multiples) gives Tesla a valuation of $1,000 per share in 2030.

In the first half of 2024, Tesla delivered 830,766 vehicles.Q1:In Q1 2024, Tesla produced 433,371 vehicles and delivered 386,810. The Tesla Model 3 and Y accounted for the majority of production and delivery in Q1.The company had an operating income of $1.2 billion for the first quarter of the year, with a net income of $1.1 billion. Cash and investments in Q1 decreased by $2.2 billion to $26.9 billion.Tesla Q1 Deliveries 2024:386,810Q2:The Tesla figures for Q2 2024 show the company produced 410,831 cars while delivering almost 444,000. The Model 3 and Y were again the most popular cars in the Tesla range, with just 21,551 \\'other models (like the Cybertruck) being delivered in the quarter.Elon Musk stated that the nearly 50% drop in profits at the end of the second quarter was \\'temporary\\' and mainly due to difficulties competing with companies like BYD and other \\'cheaper\\' brands, which offer EVs at a lower price point than Tesla.Tesla Q2 Deliveries 2024:443,956Q3:In its Q3 earnings call, Tesla reported that shares increased by 12%.This means that the earnings per share was $0.72 - far higher than investors\\' predictions of $0.60 per share.While revenue was slightly less than expected - $25.18 billion against a Wall Street projection of $25.43 billion - Musk reassured investors that he believed Tesla would be the most profitable company in the world if they can execute their plans.Latest News for TeslaTesla is regularly in the news - and not always for the right reasons. This is the latest Tesla news:In September 2024, Tesla\\'s German plant made headlines after managers were sent to the homes of employees on long-term paid sick leave. The manufacturing director of Tesla’s Berlin-Brandenburg gigafactory defended the decision describing it as a common industry practice.This move has sparked criticism from the trade union IG Metall, which represents some of the 12,000 workers at the plant, accusing Tesla of harsh working conditions contributing to high sick leave rates (sometimes reaching 15%). While Thierig argued some employees were exploiting Germany\\'s labor protection laws, IG Metall maintained that Tesla\\'s approach was worsening stress and sickness among its workforce.The same factory in September 2024 produced its 400,000th vehicle - a feat achieved in just two and a half years of operation. The factory currently only builds the Tesla Model Y.October 10th - Tesla\\'s robotaxi, the \\'Cybercab\\'Tesla revealed its highly anticipated robotaxi, or \"Cybercab\" as Elon Musk has referred to it, at the \"We, Robot\" event in Burbank, California. If launched, the Cybercab will share the roads with driverless robotaxis that are already operating in the US, developed by companies like Waymo (owned by Alphabet, Google\\'s parent company).The reveal was originally planned for August, but was delayed after Musk requested a design change. Revealed at the event, the vehicle features butterfly doors and has 2 seats. The Cybercab prototypes also don\\'t have a steering wheel or pedals, being fully \\'optimised for autonomy\\'.Musk stated that the Cybercab will cost around $30,000.Musk also wants the car to launch before 2027, but it\\'s currently unclear how realistic that timeline is.The car is also planned to charge via wireless induction charging - the prototypes had no physical charging port.There are also no plans for a front trunk, meaning production models will probably just have the rear trunk showcased at the event.It\\'s reported that Tesla aim for the range of the Cybercab to be around 200 miles.Tesla are aiming for the Cybercab to achieve around 5.5 miles per kWh - the most efficient EVs today achieve around 3-4 miles per kWh.November 6th - Tesla shares soar after Trump victoryTesla\\'s stock price has risen 37% since election night (as of Monday 11th November).On Monday 11th, the stock hit its highest price since April 2022 at $345.Since the election, Tesla has added about $300 billion in market value.Musk is now worth around $318 billion, more than $80 billion wealthier than the next richest person.A Tesla Cybertruck was spotted as part of Trump\\'s motorcade in Texas on November 20th.Tesla Company InformationTesla Company ValueWhat is Tesla’s market cap?As of November 7th 2024, Tesla has a market cap of $935.03 Billion.The automaker’s end-of-year market cap for 2023 was$789.89 billion.Tesla’s highest stock closing price was$409.97 on November 04, 2021.Since the 2024 Presidential Election in the US, Tesla has added $350 billion in market capitalisation.In comparison,Toyotaended 2023 with a market cap of$247.48 billionandVolkswagenclosed with a market cap of$64.19 billion.Tesla Market Share – how does Tesla compare to other manufacturers?Tesla sold 654,888 EVs in the US in 2023, making it the undisputed champion of EV sales in the US with a market share of 55%. For comparison, in 2022 Tesla had a 65% market share.BrandUS sales in 2023EV market shareTesla654,88855%Ford-Lincoln72,6086%General Motors75,8486.4%Volkswagen Group70,3985.9%Mercedes-Benz35,2722.9%Elon MuskElon Musk is Tesla\\'s largest shareholder with 715 million shares, the CEO and the public face of the company. He is also the CEO, CTO and Chief Designer at SpaceX, and owner and previous CEO of Twitter (rebranded as X) after a $44 billion takeover of the social media platform.Elon Musk supported Trump during the 2024 US presidential election. The former president\\'s re-election saw Tesla\\'s market value exceed $1 trillion for the first time since 2022, with Musk\\'s personal net worth topping $300 billion.What is Elon Musk\\'s Salary?Elon Musk\\'s salary at Tesla is 0$ - he doesn\\'t take payment in the \\'usual\\' form, and is instead compensated through stock options. Tesla are pushing to pay Musk $56 billion for his work over the last 6 years, as Tesla\\'s market value increased by as much as $650 billion over the last 10 years. However, the deal was blocked by a US judge who found the deal unfair to shareholders.The Calpers (the largest state public pension fund in the US) CEO stated on May 29th that, as of that day, they would vote against Elon Musk\\'s proposed pay package, as they did not believe the compensation reflected the performance of Tesla. They stressed that this position could change based on the outcome of a talk they were yet to have with Musk.The shareholder vote passed in June, by 75%.Elon Musk\\'s Pay AwardA Delaware judge ruled that Tesla couldn\\'t pay Musk its proposed $56 billion pay award, the ruling stating that Tesla had failed to prove the fairness of the package. Conflict of interest laws in Delaware mean that all investors, not just minority investors, need to be protected - the judge ruled that the pay shouldn\\'t be so large.It\\'s possible that issuing a new package with similar terms could trigger a large corporate accounting charge ($50 billion or more) due to Tesla\\'s shares being worth more in 2024 compared to 2018. There would also be a separate tax rate (up to 57%) on Musk\\'s shares.EmployeesHow many employees does Tesla have?In 2023, Tesla had 140,500 employees. This number is likely lower now in 2024 as Musk laid off the entire Supercharger team - 500 employees were fired in the cutbacks.Why did Tesla fire its Supercharger team?While Tesla or Elon Musk haven\\'t released an official statement outlining why the EV manufacturer dismissed its entire Supercharger team (approximately 500 employees), changing priorities may have prompted the sacking.Musk said on X (formerly Twitter) that Tesla is still committed to building chargers, and in 2024 $500 million will be spent on new chargers in the network. However, expansion will be slower, with the primary focus on ensuring 100% uptime and expanding existing locations.HistoryWho is the owner of Tesla?No single entity or individual fully owns Tesla.

If they can’t, the automakers have to buyregulatory creditsfrom another automaker that meets those requirements – such as Tesla, which exclusively sells electric cars.It’s a lucrative business for Tesla – bringing in $3.3 billion over the course of the last five years, nearly half of that in 2020 alone. The $1.6 billion in regulatory credits it received last year far outweighed Tesla’snet income of $721 million– meaning Tesla would have otherwise posted a net loss in 2020.“These guys are losing money selling cars. They’re making money selling credits. And the credits are going away,” said Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research and one of the biggest bears on Tesla(TSLA)shares.Tesla top executives concede the company can’t count on that source of cash continuing.“This is always an area that’s extremely difficult for us to forecast,” said Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn. “In the long term, regulatory credit sales will not be a material part of the business, and we don’t plan the business around that. It’s possible that for a handful of additional quarters, it remains strong. It’s also possible that it’s not.”The 11 states which will require a certain percentage of cars to be zero emission vehicles, or the automakers to purchase credits from a company like Tesla which has exceeded the target, are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont.Tesla also reports other measures of profitability, as do many other companies. And by those measures, the profits are great enough that they do not depend on the sales of credits to be in the black.The company reported 2020 adjusted net income, excluding items such as$1.7 billion stock-based compensation, of $2.5 billion. Its automotive gross profit, which compares total revenue from its car business to expenses directly associated with the building the cars, was $5.4 billion, even excluding the regulatory credits sales revenue. And its free cash flow of $2.8 billion was up 158% from a year earlier, a dramatic turnaround from 2018 when Tesla wasburning through cashand indanger of running out of money.Its supporters say those measures show Tesla is making money at last after years of losses in most of those measures. That profitability is one of the reasons the stock performed so well for more than a year.But the debate between skeptics and devotees of the company whether Tesla is truly profitable has become a “Holy War,” according to Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures and a leading tech analyst.“They’re debating two different things. They’ll never come to a resolution,” he said. Munster believes critics focus too much on how the credits still exceed net income. He contends that automotive gross profit margin, excluding those sales of regulatory credits, is the best barometer for the company’s financial success.“It’s a leading indicator,” of that measure of Tesla’s profit, he said. “There’s no chance that GM and VW are making money on that basis on their EVs.”The future of TeslaTesla’slofty stock performance– up 743% in 2020 – makes it one of themost valuable US companiesin the world. Yet the 500,000 cars it sold in 2020 were a sliver of more than 70 million vehicles estimated to have been sold worldwide.Tesla shares are now worth roughly as much as those of the combined 12 largest automakers who sell more than 90% of autos globally.What Tesla has that other automakers don’t is rapid growth – last week it forecast annual sales growth of 50% in coming years, and it expects to do even better than that in 2021 as other automakers struggle to get back to pre-pandemic sales levels.Tesla Inc. electric vehicles charge at a supercharger station on January 4, 2021 in Redondo Beach, California. - After shares rocketed higher in 2020 on surging auto deliveries, Tesla enters 2021 with plenty of momentum even as its vision of taking electric cars mainstream remains a way off.

Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleTesla disappoints Wall Street despite strong profitsThe entire industry is moving toward an all-electric future, both to meet tougher environmental regulations globally and to satisfy the growing appetite for EVs, partly because they require less labor, fewer parts and cost less to build than traditional gasoline-powered cars.“Something most people can agree on is that EVs are the future,” said Munster. “I think that’s a safe assumption.”While Tesla is the leading maker of electric cars, it faces increased competition as virtually every automaker rolls out their own EVs, or plan to do so.Volkswagen has passed Teslain terms of EV sales in most of Europe. GM said last week it hopes to shift completely toemissions-free carsby 2035.“The competition is rendering Tesla’s cars irrelevant,” said GLJ’ Resarch’s Johnson.  “We do not see this as a sustainable business model.”Other analysts contend Tesla’s share price is justified given how it can benefit from the shift to electric vehicles.“They’re not going to stay at 80-90% share of the EV market, but they can keep growing even with much lower market share,” said Daniel Ives, a technology analyst with Wedbush Securities. “We’re looking at north of 3 million to 4 million vehicles annually as we go into 2025-26, with 40% of that growth coming from China. We believe now they are on the trajectory that even without [the EV] credits they’ll still be profitable.”\",\n",

The number of cars Tesla sold in the first quarter missed Wall Street’s expectations by such a wide margin that it’s worth wondering how much of the electric vehicle giant’s demand problem is baked into the lofty expectations for itsrevenueand earnings growth over the next few years.“There is not a lot of visibility on where Tesla’s next leg of growth will be — whether EVs or its other projects,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder ofDataTrekResearch. “If you are going to command a premium multiple you will have to have great earnings visibility or afantastic storyon why those earnings will show up in the future. Tesla has neither at the moment.”The growth issue around Tesla has become so sensitive, that a report on Friday saying the company was getting rid of its low-cost EV plans — which were considered key to fixing its demand problem — sent the stock tumbling more than 6%. Musk rushed to refute the story in a post on his social media site, X, which erased roughly half the decline but still left it as the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 for the session. Then after the market closed, Must posted on X that the company will unveil its “robotaxi” on Aug. 8, causing a rally in after-hours trading.“Tesla needs a $25,000 compact vehicle as a flanker product to compete with the many $25,000 EVs being launched,” said Gary Black, co-founder ofFuture Fund Advisors. “Doubling down on a robotaxi vehicle at this point would be incredibly risky.”Artificial Intelligence(AI)Java Programming with ChatGPT: Learn using Generative AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Basics of Generative AI: Unveiling Tomorrows InnovationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Generative AI for Dynamic Java Web Applications with ChatGPTBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Mastering C++ Fundamentals with Generative AI: A Hands-OnBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramMarketingPerformance Marketing for eCommerce BrandsBy - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara MarketersView ProgramOffice ProductivityZero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramFinanceA2Z Of MoneyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView ProgramMarketingModern Marketing Masterclass by Seth GodinBy - Seth Godin, Former dot com Business Executive and Best Selling AuthorView ProgramAstrologyVastu Shastra CourseBy - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu ShashtriView ProgramStrategySuccession Planning MasterclassBy - Nigel Penny, Global Strategy Advisor: NSP Strategy Facilitation Ltd.View ProgramData ScienceSQL for Data Science along with Data Analytics and Data VisualizationBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)AI and Analytics based Business StrategyBy - Tanusree De, Managing Director- Accenture Technology Lead, Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence: ATCIView ProgramWeb DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramMarketingDigital Marketing Masterclass by Pam MooreBy - Pam Moore, Digital Transformation and Social Media ExpertView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)AI-Powered Python Mastery with Tabnine: Boost Your Coding SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramOffice ProductivityMastering Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 365By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramMarketingDigital marketing - Wordpress Website DevelopmentBy - Shraddha Somani, Digital Marketing Trainer, Consultant, Strategiest and Subject Matter expertView ProgramOffice ProductivityMastering Google Sheets: Unleash the Power of Excel and Advance AnalysisBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramWeb DevelopmentMastering Full Stack Development: From Frontend to Backend ExcellenceBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramFinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView ProgramData ScienceSQL Server Bootcamp 2024: Transform from Beginner to ProBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramAll of which helps explain why Tesla’s stock has struggled so much this year. Its 34% plunge makes it by far the biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100 Index since the start of January, and the worst performer on the S&P 500 Index. About 76% of the company’s current valuation is still predicated on its future earnings potential, according to a DataTrek analysis.Sales Shock“We cautionTesla sharescould fall much further still should the company not be successful in quickly restoring unit volume and revenue growth,” JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday, pointing out the risk to Tesla’s stockmarket capitalizationif it’s no longer perceived as a hyper-growth company.Tesla sold about 387,000 cars in the first quarter, while analysts on average thought that number would be around 449,000. Obviously, profit estimates for the quarter will now have to be cut, after already dropping by more than half in a year. It also puts the company on track for a second straight year of declining annual earnings. In fact, analysts on average now expect that it will take until 2026 for Tesla to exceed the level of profitability it posted in 2022.That, however, does not mean the shares are cheap. At 59 times forward earnings, Tesla’s the most expensive member of the Magnificent 7 group of big tech companies. High-flier Nvidia Corp. trades at a multiple of around 36, and Amazon.com Inc. is at 45. Yet, Tesla has the lowest growth estimates of the three for this year. And its stock is the biggest decliner in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index in 2024.Brinkman believes there’s a decent chance that Tesla’s revenue drops materially in the first quarter, “likely causing even the most bullish investors to take a sentiment check.” Analysts on average expect a slight decline of around 0.6%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Despite Wall Street’s seeming surprise over Tesla’s troubles, no one should complain they weren’t warned. Tesla first noted the weakening pace of demand in October last year. But the reaction shows how few people fully grasped the speed of the deceleration.“Analysts knew that EV growth was waning, but the extent at which it would impact sales was misunderstood on Wall Street last quarter,” Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO of 50 Park Investments, said in an interview.Potential ReboundWith all of this being said, Tesla shares could rebound in the short term as dip buyers start sniffing around. They closed at $164.90 on Friday after trading as low as $160.51 when the news of the low-cost vehicles first hit. Chart technicians, who analyze stock moves to spot such reversals in trends, say the shares appear to be finding a near-term bottom. In other words, the most intense part of the selloff may be done — at least for now.“As long as the stock stays above $150-$160 area, technically, it is trying to trace out a bottom,” 50 Park’s Sarhan said.But the company will have to show more for the stock price to have a sustained recovery. Investors need to be convinced that Tesla can return to its strong growth, fat margins and highly innovative ways. Right now the story is shrinking demand and a shaky outlook, which cuts to the heart of the company’s towering stock market valuation.“It is challenging to call a bottom at this stage because there is not a true catalyst on the horizon,” said David Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments. Stemming the bleed in the shares will require Tesla to pull a “proverbial rabbit out the hat,” he said.“It looks like Musk is trying to do just that with his latest X post on the robotaxi,” Mazza said. “But unless the company shares specific news on shoring up the core EV franchise, the impact may be illusionary.”(You can now subscribe to ourEconomic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onteslaElon MuskRevenueMarket Capitalizationfuture fund advisorsdatatrekfantastic storyTesla shares(Catch all theBusiness News,Breaking News,Budget 2024Events andLatest NewsUpdates onThe Economic Times.)Subscribe toThe Economic Times Primeand read theET ePaperonline....moreless(You can now subscribe to ourEconomic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onteslaElon MuskRevenueMarket Capitalizationfuture fund advisorsdatatrekfantastic storyTesla shares(Catch all theBusiness News,Breaking News,Budget 2024Events andLatest NewsUpdates onThe Economic Times.)Subscribe toThe Economic Times Primeand read theET ePaperonline....morelessPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionHonda’s electric scooter pricing sharpens industry debate on its strategyThere has been a massive rebound in air travel in the last three months: Akasa CEO Vinay DubeA falling rupee has a doomy message for everyone but these stocksBhavish Aggarwal kicks off Ola group restructuring.

       "   \"Vehicles at a Tesla store in Colma, California, US.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FileNew YorkCNN—Tesla reported record quarterly sales in the final three months of last year, but it wasn’t enough for it to hang onto its title as the world’s largest maker of electric vehicles.The companyreported global sales of 484,507 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a bit better than expected and up nearly 20% from what it sold in the same period of 2022. It was less than the 526,409 EVssold by Chinese automaker BYD, but Tesla stayed ahead of BYD in total full-year sales. BYD vehicles are sold in Asia and Europe but are not yet available in North America.Tesla is facing greater competition from not just BYD, but from established global automakers that are increasing their EV offerings and capacity.Telsa’s near 20% growth is down from the higher growth rate earlier this year that gave it a 38% gain for the year. And that annual growth rate is well below the 50% annual growth target set by Tesla.A view shows model BYD ATTO 3 of BYD, a Chinese automobile manufacturer, displayed during an event a day ahead of the official opening of the 2023 Munich Auto Show IAA Mobility, in Munich, Germany, September 4, 2023. REUTERS/Leonhard SimonLeonhard Simon/ReutersChina’s BYD is selling more electric cars than TeslaBut the pace of growth in demand for EVs from consumers appears to be slowing for all brands, not just Tesla. Some of the legacy automakers, such as Ford and General Motors, havepulled backEV production in the near term, even though they’ve announced plans to shift from traditional gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs in the years ahead.The EV market has seen pockets of strength, most notably in Norway, where the Norwegian Road Federation reported Tuesday that 82% of nationwide sales in 2023 were electric vehicles, up from 79% in 2022. Traditional gasoline powered cars made up less than 4% of sales in Norway last year.But the group said economic uncertainty and tight finances reduced overall vehicle sales there by 8%, with the number of EVs sold falling nearly 5%, despite the gain in market share.Tesla was once again the best selling automaker in Norway last year with a 20% share of the market, up from a 12% share of the market in 2022. The gains came despite a dispute betweenTesla and unions in Norway, Swedenand other Nordic countries, which has snarled deliveries of Teslas to Sweden and could cause additional problems going forward for the nonunion automaker.Emma Hansson, chairman of IF Metall Stockholm Country, stands on strike outside Tesla's service center in Stockholm, Sweden, on October 27.Jessica Gow/TT News Agency/ReutersNordic workers took on Elon Musk in 2023. Here’s what could happen nextTesla has responded to the growing competition and higher interest rates that have driven up the cost of ownership bycutting pricesof its vehicles, a move that has kept sales increasing but hassqueezed its profit margins.Tesla also faces a headwind in that some of its vehicles, including some of its Model 3’s, havelost the full $7,500 federal tax creditas of Monday that had been available to many US buyers. There are limits to the tax credit for EVs using Chinese batteries or materials, even if the cars are assembled in a US factory. There are also limits on the tax credits for high-income buyers.Tesla also faced some difficult headlines in recent months, including arecallordered on 2 million cars, virtually all of the vehicles it had produced for the US, due to a federal regulator’s findings that its Autodrive feature posed a safety threat because it could be used away from the highways on which it is designed to be engaged.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also generated controversy this year for his comments and tweets, such oneretweetclaiming that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.” But while those controversies caused advertisers to flee X, the social media platform he owns formerly known at Twitter, it’s not clear that what impact, if any, it has had on Tesla sales.The sales growth at Tesla is a good sign for the company according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who is a bull on Tesla shares.“This was a clear win for [Tesla CEO Elon] Musk and Tesla as hitting 1.8 million vehicles for 2023 was a major achievement in a choppy macro for EVs,” he wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.Tesla did not break out the sales of its Cybertruck, lumping it in with the luxury Model S and Model X as “other models” in the sales report. Itstarted deliveriesof the long-delayed pickup on November 30, but Musk has warned investors it will take more than a year to ramp up production of the truck.The company is late to the game in bringing an electric pickup to market, trailing offerings from Ford, GM and upstart Rivian. While Ford and GM have yet to report fourth quarter sales, Rivian reported it delivered just under 14,000 trucks in the quarter, up 73% from a year ago, and about 50,000 for the year, up 147%.Shares ofTeslawere little changed in morning trading on the slightly better-than-expected sales news Tuesday. Tesla shares doubled in 2023, recapturing just over half the losses they suffered in 2022. But they’re down 15% from their 52-week high reached in July, and they lost 5% in just the closing days of December trading.\"],\n",

On top of CEO (sorry, \"Technoking\") Elon Musk\\'s oftenerraticbehavior, the company\\'s $1.5 billioninvestmentin bitcoin earlier this year raised a fair few eyebrows. But with astockmarket value more than100 timeshigher than 2021\\'s projected profit, the most important questions arguably relate to the appropriateness of Tesla\\'s valuation. The purpose of this Pack is therefore to present you with a professional-style framework you can use to value Tesla\\'s stock for yourself allowing you to get properly informed before (or even after) you consider investing. Tesla is currently in the high-growth phase of its development as a company. That means profit and profitability are generally growing, albeit erratically. Tesla\\'s cash flow is also all over the place as it spends heavily on building new factories and increasing production and shortfalls often have to be plugged by freshsalesof shares or debt, both of which impact the company\\'s per-share valuation. Taken together, all this means that it\\'s hard to value Tesla today by simply applying a multiple to its current earnings, or else trying to forecast its medium-term cash flows and then discounting them to the present. All those variables are arguably just too volatile right now. A better approach may be to ask the following question: what will Tesla\\'s stabilized earnings look likeafterits growth phase in, say, 2030? That\\'s the path we\\'re going to take in this Pack. Based on various well-educated assumptions, we\\'ll attempt to forecast Tesla\\'s financial position in 2030 in terms of both revenue and profit and use this to value Tesla\\'s future stock. We can then discount this valuation back to the present to see what the company\\'s shares should be worth today. We can also calculate the average annualized return investors can expect given the difference between Tesla\\'s actual stock price at present and the theoretical \"fair value\" per share in 2030. But before we get to that, let\\'s kick things into gear by investigating what Tesla\\'s future revenue might loo',\n",

The Fubo Settlement, Disney, and the Death of the Venu Sports-Streaming VentureAccording to the British Competition and Markets Authority, barriers to entry are so high that not even Amazon is a real threat to Google and Facebook’s dominance. These practices allow digital platforms to raise prices, while advertisers pass the extra costs to their clients.Editor’s note:Following an extensive study, the UK’s Competition\\xa0and Markets Authority (CMA)\\xa0expressed concerns in December that Google and Facebook have grown so “large and have such extensive access to data that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms.”This is the fourth post in aserieson the status of competition in search, social media, and digital advertising markets. It explores the main preliminary findings of a largemarket studyconducted by the CMA, as well as a December 2019 antitrustcondemnation of Google in Francefor abusing its dominant position in the French market for digital ads. The rest of the series can be foundhere.Previous installments explored the CMA’s preliminary conclusions that the British markets for general search and social media are dominated by Google and Facebook, respectively. For the CMA, this dominance may harm users through reduced innovation, lower quality of services, excessive data collection, or higher prices for goods and services.Both general search and social media are two-sided markets,\\xa0where an intermediary connects two or more sides (e.g. Google connecting users and websites), such as when Apple connects app developers and iPhone users through its App Store. As such, proper analysis has to consider not only the potentially negative impacts on consumers but also the impact on publishers and advertisers. The\\xa0Competition\\xa0and Markets Authority’s study of the dynamics of digital ads, however, indicates that Google and Facebook also control digital advertising markets, where advertisers confront high prices, opacity, and many conflicts of interest.The first question the CMA faced was the extent to which digital advertising competes with legacy media such as TV, radio, or newspapers. The CMA concluded that digital advertising is a market in and of itself. Companies that rely on digital advertising cannot substitute it for traditional media because these legacy channels lack data and the ability to personalize ads and because most online advertisers are smaller companies that do not have the funds or scale required for most legacy ads.The CMA then divided online advertising markets into four non-substitutable segments: search, display advertising (advertisement on banners/videos associated with content), open display (third-party companies selling advertisement inventory on their websites, e.g. newspapers), and classified ads. It analyzed the first three, which correspond to the vast majority of expenditures in the UK.Search AdvertisementFor the CMA, the body of evidence it analyzed “suggests that Google has substantial market power in search advertising,” the market for ads that search engines display on the top of a search result.Google controls 94 percent of the market for search ads in the UK. Its control over the search advertising market is higher than its control over the search market (where it holds a 90 percent share) because Google charges more per ad than competitors and is more effective at monetizing its platform—as shown by the data gathered by the CMA on the total number of monetized clicks in the UK:Google argued that it faces strong competition from vertical search engines (such as Booking.com or Expedia in travel) and from Amazon. After a careful analysis, the CMA concluded that neither threaten Google’s dominance.That is because vertical search engines actually rely on Google for traffic—for example, 50 percent of Booking.com’s operational expenses are with ads it buys from Google. The CMA also concluded that while Amazon might develop into a relevant competitor in the search advertising market, it is unlikely to pose a threat to Google in the near future. Not only is Amazon Google’s main client in terms of search revenue, demonstrating an important vertical link, but the CMA estimates that retail ads (where Amazon could grow) account for only 18 percent of Google’s revenues with ad search, or 33 percent if all the retail sector is considered.Even in a future worst-case scenario, Google would still dominate two-thirds of the market.For the CMA, Google’s dominant position in search advertising is protected by important barriers to entry and expansion of competitors. Initially, competitors face important barriers in developing the user side of search that provides parties with inventory to sell (explored in thesecond postof this series). Search advertising also has its own important barriers to entry and expansion.First, Google restricts interoperability in these markets. This increases transaction costs in search advertising and prevents smaller advertisers from multi-homing. Second, Google controls much essential proprietary data, in particular tags in third-party websites that allow it to track the success of search ads (whether it led to sales, etc.), key metrics for the market. For example, Google’s tags are present in 88 percent of third-party UK websites, versus 1 percent of Microsoft’s tags. Finally, Google’s vertical integration creates opacity, increases the cost of entry, and enables exploitative practices by Google against advertisers.For the CMA, such practices (which the agency intends to investigate further) may harm consumers through higher prices (as businesses pass-through search costs), diminishing innovation, the charging of hidden fees, and by enabling Google to leverage its dominance in search to other markets. The CMA stressed how Google’s high margins of 44 percent, versus a cost of capital of 9 percent, would be indicative of economic exploitation in this market.Display AdvertisingThe CMA equally concluded that\\xa0Facebook has market power in display advertising, the market for\\xa0ads such as videos, banners, or sponsored pages that are displayed in owned and operated platforms (e.g. Facebook, Snapchat, or YouTube ads).Facebook accounts for almost 50 percent of the display market and is at least four times larger than Google/YouTube, the second major player. If the market is divided in video and non-video ads, something the CMA defends, Facebook’s share grows to almost 60 percent.The CMA concluded that Twitter, Snapchat, and other, smaller social media networks do not materially restrict Facebook’s market power as these companies lack scale, sophistication, and supply capacity to challenge Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Google. This highly complex and opaque market is also open to many types of abuses, such as Facebookinflating its statisticson video viewership in the platform (advertisers must rely on Facebook’s own reporting of viewership as the company restricts third-party auditing of the platform). The CMA stresses that it received many complaints reporting fraud in digital advertising metrics and that it will investigate further.While the agency stressed how fraud levels appear to be low and decreasing, it does not believe that reputational concerns alone will solve the opacity and conflicts of interest associated with the fact that the companies that sell ads are also those that report on viewership/effectiveness—largely because Facebook and Google purposefully designed these markets to be opaque and dependent on them.The CMA stressed how Facebook’s privileged position in display advertising is protected by four important barriers to entry. First, the need for scale in the development of platforms, sales teams, bidding technologies, and others. Second, network effects that attract eyeballs in social media markets and generate sales inventory (explored in thethird post). Third, Facebook’s control over user data allows it to better personalize ads, increase the reach of campaigns, and prevent other companies from offering competing ads metrics services. Finally, Facebook’s incumbent position in social media allows it to manipulate the market and prevent competitors from reaching enough scale to tackle its dominant position.For the CMA, Facebook’s dominance can negatively impact consumers through a variety of channels. These include higher consumer prices as advertisers pass through increased ad costs in Facebook’s platforms; excessive collection of user data—indeed, the CMA stressed that Facebook has a complex privacy interface and does not allow users to restrict data collection or turn off ad personalization; and increased ad costs as Facebook manipulates the supply of display advertising on its platform.For the CMA, Facebook’s high margins, estimated at 51 percent versus a cost of capital of 9 percent, would be indicative of economic exploitation in this market.Open Display AdvertisingFinally, the CMA also concluded that Google has a strong position in all segments of the open display market: ads such as videos and banners displayed in smaller scale publisher webpages (e.g. the banners or pop-up ads displayed when you access a blog or a newspaper website).This market is different from display advertising because rather than simply hiring Facebook/Snapchat to do the ad placement, smaller publishers must rely on a complex system of intermediaries that connects them to advertisers (see below).According to the CMA,\\xa0Google controls 90 percent of the ad server market, leveraging this power to other segments of the market such as demand-side platforms (where it holds a 50-70 percent share) and supply-side platforms (40-60 percent share).For the CMA, Google’s dominant position is protected by relevant barriers to entry and expansion. First, Google controls a unique database of personal data that is all but required to match advertisers and publishers in this market. Second, Google’s unique third-party tags (described above) allow it to better track users and report ads metrics without competition. Third, its 90 percent control over the publisher ad service market is protected by high switching costs, as the process of integrating a publisher’s website to an ad server is costly, complex, and may lead to much foregone revenue, forcing publishers to rely on a single supplier. Finally, Google’s vertical integration not only increases the cost of entry but also allows it to leverage its dominance over a key input to other segments, increasing its control over the whole market.Google’s opaque business also created many conflicts of interest and opened market players to all sorts of obscure charges and arbitrariness. Open display is probably the most complex and opaque market in all digital advertising, as it is highly automatized and involves a number of intermediaries between the advertiser and the publisher. For the CMA, advertisers and publishers face a lack of transparency over key aspects of the market, including measurements of effectiveness, quality, how prices are determined, and how much intermediaries are paid—by some estimates, Google and other intermediaries retain as much as 60 percent of advertising expenditures.All in all, the CMA expressed concerns that these problems are also leading to higher prices and lower quality, which are then passed on to consumers. The agency is\\xa0further investigating many of Google’s leveraging practices. In particular, the CMA stressed how open display markets are essential for the funding of startups and the survival of newspapers, so abuses in market power may have particularly pernicious effects on society.The image below summarizes the CMA’s findings regarding the main forms of consumer harm that may arise as a result of Google’s and Facebook’s dominance of online markets based on advertising:Filippo Maria Lancieri is a fellow at the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State.

       "   'Date28 September 2021TopicsCompetition and exemptionsAdvertising and promotionsDigital platforms and servicesAn ACCC inquiry into the advertising technology (or ‘ad tech’) sector has identified significant competition concerns and likely harms to publishers, advertisers and, ultimately, consumers.Thereport, published today, concludes that enforcement action under Australia’s existing competition laws alone is not sufficient to address the competition issues in the sector, and that the ACCC should be given powers to develop specific rules in response.Ad tech services facilitate complex transactions for the selling and buying of advertising space on websites or apps, resulting in the ads that are displayed to consumers.The report finds that Google has a dominant position in key parts of the ad tech supply chain and estimates that more than 90 per cent of ad impressions traded via the ad tech supply chain passed through at least one Google service in 2020.Google’s dominance in the ad tech supply chain is underpinned by multiple factors including its access to consumer and other data, access to exclusive inventory and integration across its ad tech services. Key acquisitions by Google, including of DoubleClick in 2007, AdMob in 2009, as well as YouTube in 2006 have helped Google entrench its position in ad tech.The report finds that Google has used its position to preference its own services and shield them from competition. For example, Google prevents rival ad tech services from accessing ads on YouTube, providing its own ad tech services with an important advantage.Google has also refused to participate in publisher-led header bidding, an industry innovation aimed at increasing competition for publishers’ inventory, and previously allowed its services to have a ‘last look’ opportunity to outbid rivals.“Google has used its vertically integrated position to operate its ad tech services in a way that has, over time, led to a less competitive ad tech industry. This conduct has helped Google to establish and entrench its dominant position in the ad tech supply chain,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.“Google’s activities across the supply chain also mean that, in a single transaction, Google can act on behalf of both the advertiser (the buyer) and the publisher (the seller) and operate the ad exchange connecting these two parties. As the interests of these parties do not align, this creates conflicts of interest for Google which can harm both advertisers and publishers.”Ad tech services perform an important role in the digital economy, helping Australian businesses reach consumers and publishers fund online content.The report estimates that, in Australia, at least 27 per cent of advertiser spend on ads sold via the ad tech supply chain was retained by ad tech providers in 2020.“We are concerned that the lack of competition has likely led to higher ad tech fees. An inefficient ad tech industry means higher costs for both publishers and advertisers, which is likely to reduce the quality or quantity of online content and ultimately results in consumers paying more for advertised goods”, Mr Sims said.“The ACCC is considering specific allegations against Google under existing competition laws. However new regulatory solutions are needed to address Google’s dominance and to restore competition to the ad tech sector for the benefit of businesses and consumers. We recommend rules be considered to manage conflicts of interest, prevent anti-competitive self-preferencing, and ensure rival ad tech providers can compete on their merits.”“We have identified systemic competition concerns relating to conduct over many years and multiple ad tech services, including conduct that harms rivals. Investigation and enforcement proceedings under general competition laws are not well suited to deal with these sorts of broad concerns, and can take too long if anti-competitive harm is to be prevented,” Mr Sims said.“Many of the concerns we identified in the ad tech supply chain are similar to concerns in other digital platform markets, such as online search, social media and app marketplaces. These markets are also dominated by one or two key providers, which benefit from vertical integration, leading to significant competition concerns. In many cases these are compounded by a lack of transparency.”Sector-specific regulation, such as that proposed in this report, is not new. Other industries, such as telecommunications, have specific rules which can address particular competition and transparency concerns identified in those sectors.“How the recommendations in this Report should be given effect, including the legal framework for the proposed rules and powers will be considered as part of a broader ACCC report due in September 2022,” Mr Sims said.That report will also look at whether the proposed rules for ad tech need to form part of a broader regulatory scheme to address common competition and consumer concerns we have identified in digital platform markets. Consultation on that report will commence in the first quarter of 2022 and will take into account overseas legislative proposals to deal with these issues.“We are also engaging very closely with our international counterparts who are at different stages of introducing similar rules to deal with these issues,” Mr Sims said.Google’s access to data has contributed to its dominance in ad techGoogle has access to a large volume and range of first-party data gathered through its customer-facing services, such as Search, Maps and YouTube. The extent to which Google uses its first-party data to advantage its ad tech businesses is not clear and is a source of confusion among industry stakeholders.“We recommend that Google makes clear how it uses its data through clear public statements in its terms and conditions and other material it uses to sell its services,” Mr Sims said.The report also recommends that under the proposed new sector-specific rules, the ACCC be given the power to develop and implement special measures to address competition issues caused by an ad tech provider’s data advantage, such as data separation or data access requirements to address the competition risks that may arise from the use of first party data.Need for greater transparency of the ad tech supply chainThe ACCC also found that the pricing and the operation of ad tech services lack transparency. The complexity of the supply chain contributes to this lack of transparency and can make it difficult for advertisers and publishers to understand how the supply chain is operating and detect misconduct.It recommends the industry establish standards, requiring ad tech providers to publish average fees and take rates to enable ad tech customer to easily compare fees and take rates across different ad tech providers and services. It also recommends an industry standard to enable full and independent verification of the services advertisers use in the supply chain.The report also identified specific transparency issues with Google’s publisher services, and recommends that Google should be required to provide publishers with information about the operation and outcomes of its publisher ad server auctions.“If Google fails to provide sufficient information, or the industry’s voluntary standards do not achieve transparency, then new requirements should be able to be put in place to address this,” Mr Sims said.Notes to editorsAd tech services are used in the buying and selling of digital display advertising through open display channels. They involve the automated use of complex algorithms and systems to trade digital ads on websites and apps in a matter of milliseconds.Digital display advertisements include the images or videos that appear before or alongside content viewed online. This inquiry considers the ad tech services that deliver digital display advertising to consumers, and associated advertising agency services.Display ads can appear as banners, pop-ups and videos. They can be traded through open display channels (which relies on ad tech to facilitate the buying and selling of ads) or via closed (or owned and operated channels), such as when publishers sell ads directly to advertisers using their own systems. Open display channels are the focus of this report.Size of digital advertising channels in AustraliaSource: ACCC analysis of data obtained from ad tech providers and provided by IAB AustraliaExamples of situations where individuals may view targeted display advertising include:Image or video ads shown while viewing a website in a browser on a desktop or mobile device;Image or video advertising integrated into the content of a mobile app;Videos shown during the ‘ad breaks’ in the ‘catch-up’ video streaming services of major commercial television networks.Generally, when a consumer visits a publisher’s website or app, its publisher side services send out a request to many advertisers through their advertiser-side services, asking for bids from advertisers who would like to show an ad to the consumer. The advertiser-side services and publisher-side services then run a series of automated processes, including auctions, to select a winning ad which is then sent to the publisher.The inquiry has examined four key ad tech services: advertiser ad servers, demand-side platforms, supply-side platforms and publisher ad servers.BackgroundOn 10 February 2020, the Treasurer signed a Ministerial Direction requiring the ACCC to hold a public inquiry into markets for the supply of ad tech services and ad agency services.The inquiry started in March 2020 with therelease of an issues paper, and aninterim reportwas released in January 2021.The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Branch is also conducting a separatefive-year inquiryinto markets for the supply of digital platform services. Under that inquiry, reports are provided to the Treasurer every six months.Release number149/21General enquiriesContact usto report an issue or make an enquiry.Media enquiriesMedia Team - 1300 138 917, media@accc.gov.au',\n",
       "   'AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSAN FRANCISCO — Type “buttermilk pancakes” into Google, and among the top three or four search results you will find a link to a detailed recipe complete with a photo of a scrumptious stack from a site called Knol, which is owned by Google.Google envisions Knol as a place where experts can share their knowledge on a variety of topics. It hopes to create a sort of online encyclopedia built from the contributions of scores of individuals. But while Wikipedia is collectively edited and ad-free, Knol contributors sign their articles and retain editing control over the content. They can choose to place ads, sold by Google, on their pages.While Knol is only three weeks old and still relatively obscure, it has already rekindled fears among some media companies that Google is increasingly becoming a competitor. They foresee Google’s becoming a powerful rival that not only owns a growing number of content properties, including YouTube, the top online video site, and Blogger, a leading blogging service, but also holds the keys to directing users around the Web.“If in fact a Google property is taking money away from Google’s partners, that is a real problem,” said Wenda Harris Millard, the co-chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.Money, of course, is very much at issue. The lower a site ranks in search results, the less traffic it receives from search engines. With a smaller audience, the site earns less money from advertising.Although Martha Stewart’s buttermilk pancake recipe appears lower than the Knol recipe in Google’s rankings, Ms. Millard does not believe that Google unfairly favors pages from Knol. But she said that Google’s dual role as search engine and content site raises an issue of perception. “The question in people’s minds is how unbiased can Google be as it grows and grows and grows,” Ms. Millard said.Google has always said it will never compromise the objectivity of its search results. And it says it treats Knol pages like any other pages on the Web. “When you see Knol pages rank high, they are there because they have earned their position,” said Gabriel Stricker, a spokesman for Google.There is little evidence that Knol has received favorable treatment. Many of the Knol pages that rank high on Google rank similarly high on Yahoo. (The Knol buttermilk pancakes? No. 4 with Yahoo search.)Google has long insisted that it has no plans to own or create content, and that it is a friend, not a foe, of media companies. The Google search engine sends huge numbers of users to the digital doorsteps of thousands of media companies, many of which also rely on Google to place ads on their sites. “Our vision still remains to be the best conduit that we can be, connecting people between whatever their search is and the answer they are looking for,” Mr. Stricker said. “For that reason, we are not interested in owning or creating content.”Knol is merely a tool for others to create and publish information, and once they do, Mr. Stricker said, “our job, which is to organize that information, kicks in.” Google does not own copyrights to the Knol content, and the site will not carry the Google logo, he added.Knol is not Google’s first foray into content hosting. The company has long owned Blogger, one of the most popular blogging services. It is digitizing millions of books, which it makes available through its search service. It owns the archives of Usenet, a popular collection of online discussion forums that predates the Web. Google also carries some news stories from The Associated Press in Google News, and it publishes stock market information through Google Finance. And of course, Google owns YouTube, one of the largest media sites on the Web.Critics say each new Google initiative in this area casts more doubt on the company’s claims that it is not a media company.ImageCredit...Illustration by The New York Times“Google can say they are not in the content business, but if they are paying people and distributing and archiving their work, it is getting harder to make that case,” said Jason Calacanis, the chief executive of Mahalo, a search engine that relies on editors to create pages on a variety of subjects. “They are competing for talent, for advertisers and for users” with content sites, he said.Knol has been called a potential rival to Wikipedia and other sites whose content spans a broad range of topics, including Mahalo and About.com, a property of The New York Times Company that uses experts it calls “guides” to write articles on a variety of topics.Asked whether Knol posed a threat to About.com, Martin A. Nisenholtz, senior vice president of digital operations at the Times Company, said, “About.com is very well positioned in the marketplace.” Knol could also compete with many Web sites that specialize in single topics, like WebMD in medical information or the smattering of how-to, do-it-yourself or cooking information sites and other instructional sites that are proliferating online.Some online media companies say they are unconcerned about the prospect of competing with Knol.“Assuming that Google treats Knol just like it treats other Web sites, it is just another company out there producing content,” said Richard Rosenblatt, the chief executive of Demand Media, a fast-growing online company that owns how-to content sites like eHow and ExpertVillage.Mr. Rosenblatt, who was the chief executive of Intermix Media, the parent of MySpace when it was sold to the News Corporation, said that if Knol became a popular Web destination, he would consider posting content from Demand Media’s sites on it. The company, like many others in the media business, posts many of its videos on YouTube.“We have an enormous amount of traffic on YouTube,” Mr. Rosenblatt said. “It hasn’t cannibalized ExpertVillage.”Other media companies, like WebMD, have already begun posting their content on Knol.“We participated in Google Knol as a test, as we’ve done with other, similar offerings,” a WebMD spokeswoman, Jennifer Newman, said in an e-mail message. “We are evaluating its effectiveness in further building brand awareness for WebMD.”Ms. Millard, the Martha Stewart executive, said she had considered posting content on Knol but decided against it. “You are continuing to build their business if you do that, versus building your own.”Google’s growing reach into the content business could create conflicts similar to those faced by Microsoft in its dual role as a provider of an operating system that others run their software applications on and a maker of applications, Mr. Calacanis said. It is possible that with YouTube, Knol, Blogger and other company sites, Google could take 3 of the top 10 results in some searches, he added. That could alienate Web publishers that are Google’s advertising partners, even if there is no indication that Google artificially favored its sites, he said.While Google helps drive the success of other content providers, it is clear that the company will not shy away from entering what it considers “high-value” content areas, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.“If I am a content provider and I depend upon Google as a mechanism to drive traffic to me, should I fear that they may compete with me in the future?” Professor Yoffie asked. “The answer is absolutely, positively yes.”Google has appeared even-handed with search queries, Professor Yoffie said. But he, too, believes that if Google further expands into content, it will meet some of the conflicts Microsoft faced more than a decade ago.“A lot of the issues that we saw play out between Microsoft and its ecosystem in the 1990s will play out again between Google and its ecosystem,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on, SectionC, Page1of the New York editionwith the headline:Is Google a Media Company?.Order Reprints|Today’s Paper|SubscribeSee more on:Alphabet Inc.0Share full article0AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT',\n",
       "   'De-classified: What really happened to newspapersSep 04, 2020·[[read-time]] min readShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInMailCopy linkNic HopkinsHead of News Partnerships, Australia & New ZealandShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInMailCopy linkIn the mid-1990s the status of newspapers as the main source of news to society felt both indisputable and permanent.The Internet was a novelty. We accessed the web on dial-up modems, surfed pages using Netscape and searched for information on Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos. Around the same time, across the Pacific, Amazon had only just launched an obscure online bookstore.In 1995, I began my career as a journalist atThe Advertiserin Adelaide. The web was so niche that there were fevered debates about whether we would need one “Internet terminal,” or perhaps two, for an entire newsroom.Newspapers back then could afford to take their time with technology–there was no rush. They were unassailable and spectacularly profitable, thanks largely to classified advertising. Rupert Murdoch oncedescribedclassifieds as “rivers of gold”.Today, as we all know, the landscape is vastly different. The print rivers of goldhave dried up, print circulation has sharply declined. On the face of it, the news business has never looked so vulnerable. To me, and anyone else who has worked in print or simply loves newspapers, this has been a painful process. My dad worked in newspapers–it’s in our blood.Source: AlphaBetaWhat happened?Ananalysis of the revenues of newspapersover nearly two decades, recently conducted for Google by the economists atAlphaBeta, is revealing–there is no mistaking precisely how and over what time period the old business model for newspapers broke.In 2002, Australian newspapers collected 96% of all classified advertising, which amounted to $1.6 billion. By 2018, the total classified advertising market had grown to $1.9 billion, but only 12% of that was going to newspapers–the rest has splintered off to specialist online providers such as Domain, Realestate.com.au, Carsales and Seek.Over that same period we moved from sitting at bulky desktop computers with slow connections to carrying a supercomputer in smartphone form, with instant access to news and information. Australian newspaper revenues peaked at $5.5 billion in 2007-08, just asApple introduced the iPhone. The smartphone in our pocket, able to access the content news publishers made available for free on their websites, was almost a perfect disincentive to buying the next day’s newspaper. We now consume more news, but fewer newspapers.That’s not all that has changed, of course. Over the same period we’ve seen the transformative development of search and social media platforms. Google launched ads in 2003, and it has grown to become a global business as the web itself has expanded to hundreds of billions of pages. Facebook was founded in 2004, and today almost 3 billion people use it to connect with each other around the world. Together they earn billions of dollars in revenue from commercial advertisers in Australia.A widely held view is that if Google and Facebook didn’t exist, much of this revenue would have stayed with news publishers–that these tech platforms directly disrupted the newspaper business model. ButAlphaBeta’s researchdisproves that theory: it wasn’t Google or Facebook specifically, it was technology in its entirety.Search advertising is an entirely new category which allows businesses that would never have taken out a newspaper ad to reach specific audiences right at the instant they are seeking a product or service. And they only pay if a user actually clicks on their ad. Locally, Google’s advertising customers in Australia include a multitude of small and medium-sized businesses that never would have generated a substantial proportion of a newspaper’s income. If there is an incumbent publisher that has been disrupted by search ads, it’s directory operators like the Yellow Pages.The total Australian advertising market almost doubled between 2002 and 2018 from $8.9 billion to $16.6 billion, and almost all of that growth came from search and social. But to suggest that that money would otherwise have gone to news publishers would require news publishers to have built their own search engines and social platforms. They didn’t.Every time you use Gumtree to sell a bike, browse Domain for a place to live or flick through Carsales represents the flow of money away from newspapers. Major publishers still own large stakes in these digital classifieds businesses but the revenues no longer fund journalism.However, theAlphaBeta studyalso offers hope. The business model that was broken is being re-made through technology: distribution, analytics, advertising, subscriptions. Reader contributions and subscriptions are transforming the economics of publishing news.Today we spend greater amounts of time than ever before consuming the news, and there are many innovative new publishers finding readers that would have struggled to get a foothold in the days of the printing press. There are even green shoots of growth amid the COVID destruction - Telum Mediareportedthis week that more than 30 new digital mastheads have emerged just this year.In the quarter of a century since I first began as a fledgling print journalist the news industry has been radically, often painfully, transformed. It has taken years of trial and error, but there are paths that now lead to publishing profits and prosperity.It’s my hope that Google can continue to support the news industry, through new products which pay publishers for high-quality content, and continuethe workwe have been doing for almost two decades in helping newsrooms to find new audiences, engage them with compelling stories and generate new income through digital channels.POSTED IN:',\n",
       "   'I used to get endless grief from pro-regulatory media activists here in DC when I put forward the argument in days past that Google was a media company and a major player in the battle for eyes, ears and ad dollars in America’s media marketplace. Increasingly, however, more people are coming around to seeing that point, even the crusty old media giants themselves.In a smart essayover at the Freedom to Tinker blog, David Robinson takes the New York Times to task for an article today again wondering, “Is Google a Media Company?”  As David rightly argues:I hope the Times’s internal business staff is better grounded than its reporters and editors appear to be—otherwise, the Times is in even deeper trouble than its flagging performance suggests. Google isn’t becoming a media company — it is one now and always has been. From the beginning, it has sold the same thing that the Times and other media outlets do: Audiences. Unlike the traditional media outlets, though, online media firms like Google and Yahoo have decoupled content production from audience sales. Whether selling ads alongside search results, or alongside user-generated content on Knol or YouTube, or displaying ads on a third party blog or even a traditional media web site, Google acts as a broker, selling audiences that others have worked to attract. In so doing, they’ve thrown the competition for ad dollars wide open, allowing any blog to sap revenue (proportionately to audience share) from the big guys. The whole infrastructure is self-service and scales down to be economical for any publisher, no matter how small. It’s a far cry from an advertising marketplace that relies, as the newspaper business traditionally has, on human add sales. In the new environment, it’s a buyer’s market for audiences, and nobody is likely to make the kinds of killings that newspapers once did. As I’ve argued before, the worrying and plausible future for high-cost outlets like the Times is a death of a thousand cuts as revenues get fractured among content sources.Exactly right. I’ve made a similar argument in Chapter 2 of my big “Media Metrics” report.SHARE:14comments',\n",

But times are changing.Google still has an effective monopoly on search with amarket share of 91.75%. But today’s web is far larger and more complex than in the early days of the internet. Unbundling will not pose an existential threat to Google search, but it will divide Google’s hold on the information market to a degree.At DEPT®, we believe that the “post-search” future is fueled by chatbots, generative content, marketplaces, and a rising generation’s unique approach to how they discover, search, and find information.In this playbook, we reveal three game-changing trends shaping search beyond the traditional search engine. As a marketer or brand, it’s crucial to stay ahead of the curve and adapt to these shifts to grow and maintain a successful online presence moving forward.Let’s dive in.01—AI is poweringnext-generation searchMicrosoft Bing, Google Bard, and ChatGPT are ushering in a new era of “conversational” search.Forget typing in keywords and receiving hundreds of links as a result. Search is evolving into a “natural” conversation between Chatbot and user. AI models like ChatGPT perform various natural language processing tasks, including text classification, question answering, and machine translation.A conversation-based interface would radically shift users from keyword-based systems like Google. So, what would it mean to replace the click economy and the search bar, with something like a conversation?It took only a few weeks for Microsoft Bing’s search engine to reach 100 million users. Compare that to other technologies:Source: Digital Information WorldFor years, human beings have been playing a game with rules set by machines. We try to gain insight into what signals search engines value. Then, we attempt to meet those standards so our content and websites rank favorably. There’s no doubt that plenty of talented SEO professionals play this game at an expert level, creating immense value for their companies. But, there are a lot of ways in which machines can play this game better than people.Artificial intelligence is being used to help individual companies do SEO better and faster because it can analyze patterns in data faster than humans, at scale, and in real time.AI-powered SEO tools are being deployed today by search pros to do more with less and gain competitive advantages that manual work alone just can’t match. That includes using AI to optimize existing content, suggest new topics to target, and even automate existing SEO tasks.Thanks to this power to augment and improve AI marketing use cases like SEO, McKinsey analysts writing inHarvard Business Reviewestimate that AI can create $1.4 to $2.6 trillion of value in marketing and sales alone.There’s no question… Used correctly, AI can give you SEO superpowers. Here’s how.More effectiveness, efficiency, and speedUsing AI for your SEO strategy can help you become quicker, more efficient, and more productive when it comes to managing your digital marketing.Think about it: AI is highly automated, which means that lengthy, time-consuming tasks are now eliminated. And because you don’t need to hire developers to code software, you can be more strategic in the planning and delivery of your digital content creation. The bottom line? Massive time and money savings. The information that you can dig out with AI for SEO is also incredibly accurate and up-to-date, which in turn helps boost productivity and inform meaningful business decisions.Improved user experience and customer satisfactionThe very aim of all AI tools is to provide a user experience that is as relevant, useful, and personalized as possible. In a nutshell: AI is there to make your life (and your users’ lives) better. And what happens if you manage to make your clients’ lives better by providing hyper-personalized services and products? They will come back for more and spread the word about how great your brand is.Higher rankingsLast but not least: with an AI-powered SEO strategy, you can aim for the stars. Meaning you can reach higher SERP rankings today and in the future. One of the reasons is that AI helps to craft a bespoke, stellar user experience.\\xa0 And user experience is one of the main criteria that impact your SERP ranking. In addition, AI for SEO will help you to lift your rankings because it enables you to discover and use exactly the right keywords, topics, and content that your audience is searching for.Today, any SEO expert can leverage AI and ChatGPT to help them with text compilation, summarization, questions and answers, chat, and translations.So will ChatGPT finally spell the end of search engines? Doubtful.While it will probably siphon off some usage from search engines, it’s difficult to imagine a wholesale change in global user behavior that completely upends Google in the short term.While SEOs are well-accustomed to grappling with their mortality, the past year is the first time that think-pieces threatened Google’s existence. First withGen Z’s extensive use of TikTokand now with theAI chatbots. It’s not to say that empires don’t fall, nor that they can’t collapse quickly. Any good financial advisor would caution that past performance isn’t indicative of future results, but even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in thisarticle with The Verge,“I think whenever someone talks about technology being the end of some other giant company, it’s usually wrong. I think people forget they get to make a countermove here, and they’re like pretty smart, pretty competent. I do think there’s a change for search that will probably come at some point – but not as dramatically as people think in the short term.”02— Social media isGenZ’s search engineof choiceSocial media is the new search engine for younger generationsIn a study run by Google in 2022, they found that almost 40% of young people, when looking for a place for lunch, don’t go to Google Maps or Search. They go to TikTok or Instagram.Nowadays, links as search results are not enough. Consumers are generally more interested in visually rich forms of search and discovery, as well as reviews from people they can trust.Source: GWI, Business wireTraditional advertising is losing the brand discovery throne to social mediaTikTok recently released Search ads, but it’s not something new to social media. Pinterest has had the option to target ads based on keywords for ages, and the same for Twitter.But the fact that TikTok now also focuses on this means that they also acknowledge that more people are using social media to search for topics rather than getting served random content in their feed.It has never been more important to have your organic and paid media working together across social platforms.Social media is moving from a connection-led approach to a discovery-led approach.That means content is served based on what people watch and engage with rather than who they’re following on the platform. Content is more relevant to who they are and what they want to see, ultimately giving brands quicker access to the people that want to buy from them.This coupled with how digestible content is in places like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts means that it is only natural that they go there to search for what they want to know more about. Of course, that also means they consume the content and buy from the brands that help them do that.It is critically important that the content you develop for organic and paid channels addssomething tothe lives of your audience.How to leverage social media for search and discoveryBe a first moverBeing a first mover can be powerful for brands, so sign up where applicable. You’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain.Stay up to date with social platform’s latest ad offerings and lean into changes. For example, TikTok has released TikTok Search Ads for advertisers to tap into. The platform is planning to lean into the search space as a priority this year, with plans to launch its own search ads platform. Instagram is also capitalizing on search functionality with the announcement of ads in search results.Prioritize discoverabilityStart paying attention to visual search, it’s how most of today’s discovery organically happens.Experiment with producing engaging content that shows up in discovery spaces like Reels, TikTok, or query-based videos. Use captions, hashtags, and text in your videos to rank higher in search. Once this baseline is set up, connect your physical showroom to your socials with live video and product feeds to reflect your physical store experience. This will create the full funnel of discovery>>purchase on a single platform.Treat TikTok like your shop windowSocial media is the new SEO, so take your social media pages and profiles seriously.Get your shops set up by uploading your product catalogs to social media platforms. Traditionally people went online to find products, but now products find us. Look after your advocates and make the most of user-generated content. Your existing fans are an asset if you reward them for loyalty. Harness this by encouraging your followers and customers to create and share videos.03—Retail media networks are thefuture of product discoveryRetail browsing was historically conducted in store or in printThe internet changed this, bringing first the browsing capability to an online format. Over time, grew accustomed to shopping online and have also started using mobile devices to browse and purchase products. E-commerce has significantly impacted the way we search for products, with retailers having played a vital role in shaping this change.The 90sRetail browsing happens predominantly in-store. The first online marketplace launches. Amazon and eBay launch.The 00sOnline browsing picks up as digital storefronts become a retail norm. This is encouraged with the launch of Shopify in 2006.The 10sShopping moves to mobile, and e-commerce escalates quickly. Amazon launches ads and the first retail media network in 2012.The 20sMost people begin their product searches on online marketplaces. Retail media networks like Walmart, ebay, Alibaba and Target are quickly on the rise.Amazon has surpassed Google for product searches on the internetIn fact, many people now begin their product searches on Amazon, giving the e-commerce giant a consistent audience for its search function and opening up opportunities to refine the customer experience.Amazon and other retailers’ search tools need only index the products sold on their sites. They don’t have to answer complex questions, scouring the entirety of the internet in the process (like Google). They live by more basic principles, focused on relevancy and sales velocity.Retail media is the second fastest-growing sector of digital marketingAside from connected TV, retail media is the fastest-growing sector of digital marketing, with projections of 100B dollars in ad spend in the next few years.While Amazon comprises the majority of the space in the US, others are growing rapidly as well. Retailers such as Walmart and Kroger are now looking to replicate Amazon’s success. As retailers’ share of ad spending increases, expect to see other retail media marketplaces invest in their capabilities as well.Retail media is a game-changing approach that combines customer behavior data and high-quality inventory to help brands reach potential customers throughout their entire buying journey, from the first interaction to loyalty.By representing your brand at the point of sale, you can optimize each part of your campaigns and drive conversions without the need to build your own infrastructure. This approach allows you to leverage the extensive reach of marketplaces to drive sales, improve brand awareness, and increase ROI.How you can leverage retail media for your brandProduct visibility optimization leads to an increase in brand awarenessProduct visibility on marketplaces is a key step in the customer journey. Take advantage of a new platform to increase brand awareness and build brand loyalty. For quick wins, optimize your product titles, descriptions, and images to ensure they appear in relevant search results. Use search term reports to identify high-performing keywords and adjust bids and budgets.Use sponsored and display ads to showcase your brand values, unique selling points, and customer reviews. Use search advertising to target customers searching for products similar to yours and increase your brand exposure to a wider audience.Leverage each platform’s data sets for personalized customer experiencesRetail media marketplaces offer various engagement tools, allowing you to interact with customers and create a personalized shopping experience. Gain access to real-time performance data and optimize your campaigns for better results. Use targeting options that allow you to reach specific audiences based on demographics, interests, and behaviors.Focus on quality content to optimize performanceCreate eye-catching ads to stand out from the crowd and highlight your product. This includes video ads to showcase products, customer testimonials, and your brand story. Interactive content, like 360-degree product images or tours, show products in unique and creative ways.Limitless growth in search requires a combination of people and technology to succeed.To prepare yourself for next week and next year, you need to understand the future of search marketing. Traditional search engines will continue to have their place, but chatbots, generative content, marketplaces, and social media platforms are continuously evolving. Wherever users go to search for information, products, and local services is where you need to be.Need help in search marketing?

Google Base would allow searchers to pull up information organized by any subject. Google, however, has not said how it will display information organized into groupings, like homes, cars or jobs. Initially, the service will be free.During an interview at Google headquarters last week, Salar Kamangar, Google's vice president for product management, said the new service was experimental and cautioned against viewing it as a imminent assault on the classified advertising business because it could be used in far broader ways.Still, several industry executives and analysts said they believed that Google Base was an aggressive first step in a series of maneuvers that would position the company as a powerful player in the $100 billion annual market for classified advertising.The general industry perception is that Google could potentially transform that market, which has already been shaken by the rapid shift to online searching and the free listing services offered by Craigslist.We are having trouble retrieving the article content.Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

With a smaller audience, the site earns less money from advertising.Although Martha Stewart\\'s buttermilk pancake recipe appears lower than the Knol recipe in Google\\'s rankings, Ms. Millard does not believe that Google unfairly favors pages from Knol. But she said that Google\\'s dual role as search engine and content site raises an issue of perception. \"The question in people\\'s minds is how unbiased can Google be as it grows and grows and grows,\" Ms. Millard said.Google has always said it will never compromise the objectivity of its search results. And it says it treats Knol pages like any other pages on the Web. \"When you see Knol pages rank high, they are there because they have earned their position,\" said Gabriel Stricker, a spokesman for Google.There is little evidence that Knol has received favorable treatment. Many of the Knol pages that rank high on Google rank similarly high on Yahoo. (The Knol buttermilk pancakes? No. 4 with Yahoo search.)Google has long insisted that it has no plans to own or create content, and that it is a friend, not a foe, of media companies.
