Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, is shaking things up once again. Despite recently announcing significant job cuts, Meta is proving that innovation never sleeps by introducing a new Wearables Unit. Exciting times ahead! Now, I know what you might be thinking: Wait, didn't Meta just lay off a bunch of employees? How can they afford to launch a new division? Well, let me break it down for you. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, explained that the company is undergoing a major reorganization to improve efficiency and focus on key growth areas. And apparently, wearable technology is one of those areas. Zuckerberg believes that wearables will play a crucial role in the future of augmented and virtual reality, which are central to Meta's long-term vision. ## Cutting Jobs to Fuel Innovation So, how does cutting jobs fit into this plan? It's all about strategic allocation of resources. By streamlining certain departments and eliminating redundancies, Meta aims to free up resources that can be invested in new initiatives like the Wearables Unit. It's a bold move, but one that could pay off big time. Just imagine the possibilities: smart glasses that overlay digital information in the real world, fitness trackers that seamlessly integrate with virtual workouts, or even high-tech clothing that adapts to your environment.

       "   'On Wednesday (Sept. 25), the first ofMeta’s two-dayMeta Connect 2024conference, Meta CEOMark Zuckerbergunveiled an ambitious vision for the future of wearable technology. The event showcased significant innovations, particularly the highly anticipatedOrionaugmented reality (AR) glasses, which aim to redefine how users engage with digital content in their everyday lives. TheMeta Quest 3Sheadset was also introduced, offering high-quality immersive experiences at an accessible price point. These advancements reflect Meta’s focus on integrating innovative technology into daily routines, enhancing both personal and social interactions. Meta’s new product announcements embody what Zuckerberg termed as “the future of human connection.” Zuckerberg introduced the Orion prototype, a project a decade in the making that aims to revolutionize wearable technology. Designed to be lightweight (under 100 grams) and resembling regular glasses rather than a headset, Orion features bright, wide field-of-view displays for multitasking and entertainment. It allows users to see the physical world while overlaying digital content, rather than just using passthrough technology. A major focus of Zukerberg’s keynote was ademonstration of the Orion AR glasses. These glasses are designed to integrate visuals directly into the lenses, offering a new level of augmented experiences. Unlike the existingRay-Ban smart glasses, which do not feature screens, the Orion prototype promises to deliver more immersive AR functionalities. While they are not expected to be available for immediate purchase, seeing them in action provides a glimpse into Meta’s vision for the future of AR technology. “Orion are the most advanced glasses the world has ever seen,” Zuckerberg said during his keynote address to open the conference. Orion is equipped with advanced voice controls, hand and eye tracking for intuitive navigation, and a discreet interface for user interaction. The device incorporates ten custom silicon chips and a novel display architecture, alongside an EMG wristband for seamless input. This prototype represents a significant leap toward achieving a new wave of human-oriented computing, enhancing social interactions across distances. Zuckerberg announced thelaunch of the Meta Quest 3S, set to release on Oct. 15 for $299. This new headset features the same advanced processing capabilities as theQuest 3, but at a more accessible price point. The Quest 3S is designed for high-quality mixed reality experiences, boasting 4.5 times the resolution and improved graphics compared to its predecessor, the Quest 2. With an emphasis on comfort and usability, the Quest 3S is positioned to attract both casual gamers and serious virtual reality (VR) enthusiasts. According to a Wednesdayblog post from Meta, consumers can try its entry model 128GB Quest 3S, upgrade to the 256GB SKU for more storage, or try the 512GB Quest 3 for $500. Additionally, all three headsets will include the game “Batman: Arkham Shadow,” as well asother contentthat includes access to streaming services and fitness apps. Meanwhile, earlier this month at theChina International Optoelectronic Exposition(CIOE),Gyges Labsunveiled DigiWindow, the world’s smallest near-eye display, the Singapore-based company said in a Tuesday (Sept. 24)news release. The launch\\xa0marks a significant advancement in AI glasses and addresses the current market’s challenges, as many existing models remain bulky and impractical for everyday use. DigiWindow, measuring less than 0.1 cc, integrates seamlessly into regular eyeglass frames, providing a discreet way to display information visible only to the wearer, the company said. This feature enhances user privacy and comfort, offering a full week of battery life. DigiWindow “offers clear advantages in weight, size, light leakage, and cost,” ensuring a more user-friendly experience, according to the release. Gyges Labs’ officials want to make AI glasses as ubiquitous as smartphones. Founder Jia Jieyang emphasized the goal of empowering individuals with this technology,stating: “Our aim is to make AI glasses as common as smartphones, moving beyond niche tech enthusiasts and into everyday life.” For all PYMNTS digital transformation coverage, subscribe to the dailyDigital Transformation Newsletter.

On Wednesday, The Informationreportedthat Apple has “sharply scaled back its Vision Pro production since the early summer,” and the company could stop making its existing version by year-end. The reason: few people are buying the $3,500 headset. After a splashy February 2024 launch, interest in the Vision Pro evaporated.

Meta, meanwhile, has been crushing the wearable-tech game. Counterpoint Research reported that Meta had a74%market share of headsets in Q2 2024, and the social-media giant sold 3 million Quest 3 units, which were priced at $499 and $649 at their October 2023 release, through the first three quarters after the device’s launch, vs Apple’s 370,000 sales. However, Meta’s biggest recent hit has been its partnership with Ray-Ban. On Monday, TechCrunchreportedthat Meta’s smart glasses have been outselling traditional Ray-Bans in international markets, and they are the top-selling product in 60% of all Ray-Ban stores across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. This comes a month after EssilorLuxottica, Ray-Ban’s parent organization,inkeda long-term deal with Meta to continue collaborating on next-generation eyewear products. Why has Apple struggled while Meta has been so successful? Let’s start with the latter: Meta’s two products, the Quest and its Ray-Bans, offer two totally different value props. The Quest is primarily agaming and entertainment tool. While users can “work” from their Quest devices, most users play video games, watch shows and movies, or do immersive activities like learning new skills, and, importantly, it’s treated as an entertainment device, separate from their real world. The Ray-Bans, on the other hand, seamlessly integrate with the real world. First, they look like normal sunglasses, unlike the Vision Pro or Quest, which are clunky on your face, so there’s little friction involved with wearing them in public. Functionally, they also integrate with simple,real-world tasks: users can make calls, send texts, take photos, and ask their sunglassesquestionsabout their environment. Basically, the Meta Ray-Bans are normal sunglasses that happen to be able to handle common tasks you use your phone for while walking around. Apple’s problem was that it tried to sell its headset as a luxury product without establishing consumer demand. Sure, you can “work” from a Vision Pro, but it’s still less effective than simply using a laptop if you’re in public, or a computer with monitors in the office. Additionally, it just… looks weird. We all saw the videos of folks using their Vision Pros on the subway and while walking around earlier this year, and they looked awkward. Unlike the Meta Ray-Bans, which are nondescript, the Vision Pro is really, really descript. If the Vision Pro is less effective for working than a computer, and it’s cumbersome to wear in public, you’re left with an entertainment headset that costs 7x more than a similar competitor. After the novelty of a new product wears off, if you can’t differentiate, customers are going to opt for the cheaper option. Complicated, opaque partnerships raise concerns of competition and fair business practices in a fast-moving industry. Anew studyby Pew Research found that 26% of US teens have used ChatGPT for schoolwork, up 13% from 2023. Students in 11th and 12th grade were most likely to have used OpenAI’s chatbot, coming in at 31% of the survey. 79% of students had heard of ChatGPT, and students from wealthy households were more likely to have heard of it. When asked about the ethics of using the tool for schoolwork, 54% of respondents thought it was acceptable to use to research new topics, but 42% thought it was not acceptable to use to write essays.

       "   \"Command Line/Meta/TechThe kinds of devices Meta wants to make nextThe kinds of devices Meta wants to make next/A peek into the hardware development process at Reality Labs: “If there’s a part of your body that could potentially host a wearable that could do AI, there’s a good chance we’ve had a team run that down.”ByAlex Heath,a deputy editor and author of theCommand Linenewsletter. He has over a decade of experience covering the tech industry.Oct 11, 2024, 1:37 PM UTCShare this storyThreadsPhoto by Vjeran Pavic / The VergeWhen I recently met with Meta’s top executives, I wanted to know about more than thecompany’s first AR glasses, Orion.In the weeks leading up to our meeting, reports had surfaced about new devices the company’s hardware division, Reality Labs, was working on, fromcamera earbudsto mixed reality goggles. I had also been hearing rumors of tinkering on new variations of AI-enabled wearables. During my interview with Meta CTO Andrew “Boz” Bosworth just before this year’sConnect conference, we discussed not only some of these possible future products but also how Meta approaches hardware development in general, which I haven’t seen the company explain publicly before.“If there’s a concept that you could imagine, we either have had or do have somebody building a thing around it,” Bosworth told me. He described a multiphase development process for how Reality Labs takes products from inception to shipping. First, there’s a “pre-discovery team” that is “prototyping the craziest stuff.” They put a “proof of experience” together, and then, after executive review, a “small number” of these concepts graduate to what Meta calls its “discovery” phase, where a product is assigned “a few” dedicated employees to examine what the industrial design would be, along with other factors like cost.Then, a device enters prototyping, where there are “maybe 10 times more people involved” to build hardware and software that works together. After successfully going through prototyping, a device gets onto the official product roadmap. At that point, “we’ve got a full team assigned to it and the presumptive plan is to ship it.” Roughly half of the devices that get through prototyping go to the final “engineering validation test” phase, which determines whether management kills or greenlights a product to be manufactured at scale and released. According to Bosworth, “about half” of what gets through final validation testing actually ships publicly.He acknowledged that, somewhere early in this process, the company is tinkering with the idea of earbuds with cameras, which would presumably be used to sense the world around the wearer to aid the usefulness of the Meta AI assistant. (“We know Apple’s doing a thing there,” too, he mentioned.) He also confirmedThe Information’sreportingthat there is work underway on a pair of steampunk-like goggles for mixed reality. They recently moved from prediscovery to the discovery phase.He also confirmed a recent internal decision to abandon a higher-end Quest headsetcodenamed La Jolla, which was slated to arrive around 2027. I reported last year that the goal was to “make it higher resolution for work use.” But Meta decided to not release La Jolla after the tepid reaction to the Quest Pro. Though Bosworth didn’t acknowledge it, I have to imagine that the weak response to Apple’s Vision Pro also played a factor in the decision.When Meta was still called Facebook and just getting into consumer hardware, it wasn’t developing so many different products at once. Now, with the Quest line of headsets more established and its smart glasses with Ray-Ban seeing early traction, Meta seems to be thinking aggressively about what kinds of new AI-powered devices it could build next.“We definitely don’t want to be outflanked by someone who came up with some clever, integrated wearable that we hadn’t thought about,” Bosworth said. “If there’s a part of your body that could potentially host a wearable that could do AI, there’s a good chance we’ve had a team run that down.”In addition tomy conversation withMark Zuckerbergabout his vision for AR and smart glasses, I also spoke with Bosworth about the company’s new 10-year deal with EssilorLuxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban.The idea for the partnership going forward, according to Bosworth, is that Meta’s “technology is just one of the components that can be in any glasses that they design. That’s what we want to have happen.”Though it hasn’t been announced yet, here’s how he described the rationale for Meta’s plan to buy a noncontrolling stake in the eyewear giant: “They want the margin. We want the volume. That’s the tension, and we found a good solution to it, so we’re pretty excited about it.”Overheard“I’m particularly proud of the fact that one of my students firedSam Altman.” –Geoffrey Hintonreferring toIlya Sutskeverwhileaccepting the Nobel Prize in physics.Ina follow-up Q&A: “OpenAI was set up with a big emphasis on safety… Over time, it turned out thatSam Altmanwas much less concerned with safety than with profits.

       "   \"John Corcione JC's Place·Follow3 min read·Jun 19, 2024--ListenShareMeta Reorganizes, Introduces Wearables Unit Despite Job CutsHave you heard the latest buzz from the tech world? Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, is shaking things up once again. Despite recently announcing significant job cuts, Meta is proving that innovation never sleeps by introducing a new Wearables Unit. Exciting times ahead!Now, I know what you might be thinking: Wait, didn’t Meta just lay off a bunch of employees? How can they afford to launch a new division? Well, let me break it down for you.Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, explained that the company is undergoing a major reorganization to improve efficiency and focus on key growth areas. And apparently, wearable technology is one of those areas. Zuckerberg believes that wearables will play a crucial role in the future of augmented and virtual reality, which are central to Meta’s long-term vision.Cutting Jobs to Fuel InnovationSo, how does cutting jobs fit into this plan? It’s all about strategic allocation of resources. By streamlining certain departments and eliminating redundancies, Meta aims to free up resources that can be invested in new initiatives like the Wearables Unit.It’s a bold move, but one that could pay off big time. Just imagine the possibilities: smart glasses that overlay digital information in the real world, fitness trackers that seamlessly integrate with virtual workouts, or even high-tech clothing that adapts to your environment. The potential is endless!Learning from the PastOf course, Meta isn’t the first tech giant to venture into wearables. Remember Google Glass? While it didn’t quite take off as expected, it paved the way for future innovations. And let’s not forget about the Apple Watch, which has become a staple accessory for many.Meta seems to be taking notes from these past experiences and is poised to put its own unique spin on wearable technology. With its vast resources and expertise in virtual reality, Meta could be the one to finally crack the code and make wearables mainstream.The Road AheadSo, what can we expect from Meta’s Wearables Unit? Details are still scarce, but rumor has it that the company is working on a range of devices, from smart glasses to fitness trackers. And with Meta’s track record of pushing boundaries and thinking outside the box, we can expect some truly groundbreaking innovations.But here’s the thing: success in the wearables market isn’t just about having cool gadgets. It’s about creating products that seamlessly integrate into people’s lives and solve real problems. Meta will need to focus on user experience, battery life, and privacy concerns if it wants to win over consumers.Only time will tell if Meta’s gamble on wearables will pay off. But one thing is for sure: the tech world will be watching closely. So, buckle up and get ready for an exciting ride as Meta charts a new course in the world of wearable technology!Check Out My Other Platforms\",\n",
       "   \"TechMeta's Wearables Succeed as Apple’s Vision Pro Faces ChallengesbyInside Telecom StaffOctober 25, 2024Reading time: 2 minApple’s Vision Pro production is reportedly being scaled back this year, driven by Meta’s wearable technology competition, including its Quest 3 and Ray-Ban smart glasses, dominates the market, according toThe Information.Once expected to revolutionize augmented reality (AR), demand for Apple’s high-end Vision Pro headset slumped, leading to a reduction in its production output.According to reports fromThe Information, Apple has drastically scaled back its production of the wearables market ecosystem of Vision Pro since early summer. The tech giant may cease to make the current model altogether by the end of the year.Launched at $3,500 in February 2024, the early success of Vision Pro quickly cooled off.According toCounterpoint Research, sales of Vision Pro fell by 80% between the first quarter (Q1) and the second (Q2) in 2024, while app releases also fell sharply for the headset. Having projected as many as 800,000 units in 2024, Apple reportedly revised that figure to around 400,000 units.Success of Meta with the Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Smart GlassesMeta’s wearable ecosystem is booming, capturing 74% of the headset market in Q2 2024, according toCounterpoint Research.Since its launch in October of last year, Meta has sold 3 million united of its Quest 3 headsets, far surpassing Apple’s Vision Pro which comparatively sold only 370,000 units.One of the most successful projects undertaken byMetahas been its work on smart glasses in collaboration with Ray-Ban, providing users with practical features in a familiar stylish form which increased the wearable technology design competition.According toTechCrunch,Meta’s Ray-Ban smart glasseshave outsold traditional Ray-Bans in parts of the world and are now the top-seller in 60% of Ray-Ban stores across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.Success here has translated into a long-term agreement with Meta and Ray-Ban’s parent company, Essilor Luxottica, to make sure collaborations continue on wearable technology competition.Competitive Wearable Technology EcosystemMeta’s strategy for increasingly competitive wearable devices is in its two major offerings the Quest 3 and Ray-Ban smart glasses-mirrors the different needs of users of those devices.Quest 3 is an entry-level entertainment tool developed for gamers and media consumers, offering a more accessible substitute to high-end headsets, such Apple’s Vision Pro. Priced at about one-fifth of Apple’s AR set, the Quest 3 provides a no-frills, versatile pure-entertainment experience.Meta’s smart glasses integrate into your daily life with diversified features, such as the ones present in Ray-Ban, to call, text, take photos, and gather information while on the move-all within frames that look a lot like regular shades. Subtle in both build and functionality, they’re pretty user-friendly-especially in comparison with the bulkier build of the Vision Pro.The fact that Meta ‘s wearable technology competition continues to make waves in wearable technology meansApplewill have to go back to the drawing board if it wants to stay ahead for the future competition of wearables industry.Inside Telecom provides you with an extensive list of content covering all aspects of the tech industry.

       "   'TechMeta and the Future of Wearable TechOct 2nd 2024\\n\\nbyKevin KingAI created, human edited.In a recent episode ofThis Week in Tech, hostLeo Laporteand guests Parmy Olson, Denise Howell, and Daniel Rubino delved into the exciting world of Augmented Reality (AR) glasses. The discussion centered around recent developments from tech giants Meta and Apple, highlighting the potential and challenges of this emerging technology.Meta\\'s Ray-Ban Smart Glasses: A Step in the Right Direction?Leo Laporte kicked off the conversation by praising Meta\\'s Ray-Ban smart glasses, which he wore during the podcast. These glasses look like regular eyewear and have been selling well due to their discreet design. Parmy Olson emphasized the importance of aesthetics in wearable tech, noting that Meta\\'s success stems from creating glasses that \"don\\'t look like tech glasses\" and avoid making users \"look nerdy and awful.\" The panel agreed that Meta\\'s approach of starting simple and gradually adding features is a smart strategy. This contrasts with Apple\\'s Vision Pro, which the group perceived as potentially overreaching.Apple\\'s Vision Pro: Too Much, Too Soon?The discussion turned critical when Apple\\'s upcoming Vision Pro headset was discussed. Leo Laporte expressed skepticism about the $3,500 price point and questioned whether consumers are ready to \"strap a heavy computer on their face.\" Daniel Rubino suggested that Apple might have approached product development from the wrong end, cramming in every imaginable feature instead of starting simple and building up.Parmy Olson noted the peculiarity of Apple\\'s strategy, given that they typically start with a basic product and expand features over time, as they did with the iPhone. The group speculated on whether Apple might be working on a lighter, more affordable version of the Vision Pro to address these concerns.The Future of AR: Opportunities and ChallengesThe conversation then shifted to the potential applications and implications of AR technology on the heels of Meta’s unveiling of Orion at Meta Connect 2024:Real-time Translation: Leo Laporte mentioned the possibility of simultaneous translation, allowing real-time conversations across language barriers.Facial Recognition: Daniel Rubino brought up the potential for facial recognition, suggesting glasses could provide instant information about people you meet.Privacy Concerns: Denise Howell raised important questions about privacy, particularly in states with two-party consent laws for recording.Advertising: The panel speculated on how AR might be used for advertising, with Daniel Rubino half-jokingly suggesting we might see ads popping up in our real-world view.The Augmented Road AheadWhile the future of AR glasses remains uncertain, theTWiTpanel agreed that the technology holds immense potential. As Parmy Olson noted, \"The more the tech disappears and it doesn\\'t look like tech anymore... there\\'s just going to be a whole boatload of new data and information\" for companies to utilize.This Week in Tech\\'s 999th episode emphasized the delicate balance tech companies must strike between innovation, user experience, and privacy concerns as they push forward in the spaces like AR.Want to hear more in-depth analysis and lively debate on the latest in tech?

       "   'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaWearable computer glassesThis article is about wearable computing. For window glass with variable opacity, seesmart glass. For the Xbox control application, seeXbox SmartGlass.Using thetouch padbuilt on the side of the 2013Google Glassto communicate with the user\\'s phone usingBluetoothMan wearing a 1998EyeTapDigital Eye Glass[1]Smartglassesorsmart glassesare eye or head-wornwearable computers. Many smartglasses include displays that add information alongside or to what the wearer sees.[1][2][3]Alternatively, smartglasses are sometimes defined as glasses that are able to change their optical properties, such as smart sunglasses that are programmed to change tint by electronic means.[4]Alternatively, smartglasses are sometimes defined as glasses that include headphone functionality.A pair of smartglasses can be considered anaugmented realitydevice if it performspose tracking.Superimposing information onto a field of view is achieved through anoptical head-mounted display(OHMD) orembeddedwireless glasses with transparentheads-up display(HUD) oraugmented reality(AR) overlay. These systems have the capability to reflect projected digital images as well as allowing the user to see through it or see better with it. While early models can perform basic tasks, such as serving as a front end display for a remote system, as in the case of smartglasses utilizing cellular technology or Wi-Fi, modern smart glasses are effectively wearable computers which can run self-containedmobile apps. Some arehandsfreeand can communicate with the Internet vianatural languagevoice commands, while others use touch buttons.[5][6][7][8][9]Like othercomputers, smartglasses may collect information from internal or external sensors. It may control or retrieve data from other instruments or computers. In most cases, it supports wireless technologies like Bluetooth,Wi-Fi, andGPS. A small number of models run amobile operating systemand function asportable media playersto send audio and video files to the user via aBluetoothor WiFi headset.[10][11]Some smartglasses models also feature fulllifeloggingandactivity trackercapability.[12][13][14][15]Smartglasses devices may also have features found on asmartphone.[16][17]Some haveactivity trackerfunctionality features (also known as \"fitness tracker\") as seen in someGPS watches.[18][19]Features and applications[edit]As with other lifelogging andactivity trackingdevices, theGPS tracking unitand digital camera of some smartglasses can be used to record historical data. For example, after the completion of a workout, data can be uploaded into a computer or online to create a log of exercise activities for analysis. Some smart watches can serve as fullGPS navigation devices, displaying maps and current coordinates. Users can \"mark\" their current location and then edit the entry\\'s name and coordinates, which enables navigation to those new coordinates.[20][21]Although some smartglasses models manufactured in the 21st century are completely functional as standalone products, most manufacturers recommend or even require that consumers purchase mobile phone handsets that run the same operating system so that the two devices can be synchronized for additional and enhanced functionality. The smartglasses can work as an extension, forhead-up display(HUD) or remote control of the phone and alert the user to communication data such as calls, SMS messages, emails, and calendar invites.[22]Security applications[edit]Smart glasses could be used as abody camera.  In 2018, Chinese police inZhengzhouandBeijingwere using smart glasses to take photos which are compared against a government database usingfacial recognitionto identify suspects, retrieve an address, and track people moving beyond their home areas.[23][24]Healthcare applications[edit]Severalproofs of conceptforGoogle Glasseshave been proposed in healthcare. In July 2013,Lucien Engelenstarted research on the usability and impact of Google Glass inhealth care. Engelen, who is based atSingularity Universityand in Europe at Radboud University Medical Center,[25]is participating in the Glass Explorer program.[26]Key findings of Engelen\\'sresearchincluded:The quality of pictures and video are usable for healthcare education, reference, and remote consultation. The camera needs to be tilted to different angle[27]for most of the operative proceduresTele-consultation is possible—depending on the available bandwidth—during operative procedures.[28]A stabilizer should be added to the video function to prevent choppy transmission when a surgeon looks to screens or colleagues.Battery life can be easily extended with the use of an external battery.Controlling the device and/or programs from another device is needed for some features because of a sterile environment.Text-to-speech (\"Take a Note\" toEvernote) exhibited a correction rate of 60 percent, without the addition of a medicalthesaurus.A protocol or checklist displayed on the screen of Google Glass can be helpful during procedures.[citation needed]Dr. Phil Haslam and Dr. Sebastian Mafeld demonstrated the first concept for Google Glass in the field of interventional radiology. They demonstrated the manner in which the concept of Google Glass could assist a liver biopsy and fistulaplasty, and the pair stated that Google Glass has the potential to improve patient safety, operator comfort, and procedure efficiency in the field of interventional radiology.[29]In June 2013, surgeon Dr. Rafael Grossmann was the first person to integrate Google Glass into the operating theater, when he wore the device during a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) procedure.[30]In August 2013, Google Glass was also used atWexner Medical Center at Ohio State University. Surgeon Dr. Christopher Kaeding used Google Glass to consult with a colleague in a distant part ofColumbus, Ohio. A group of students at The Ohio State University College of Medicine also observed the operation on their laptop computers. Following the procedure, Kaeding stated, \"To be honest, once we got into the surgery, I often forgot the device was there. It just seemed very intuitive and fit seamlessly.\"[31]16 November 2013, in Santiago de Chile, the maxillofacial team led by Dr.gn Antonio Marino conducted the first orthognathic surgery assisted with Google Glass in Latin America, interacting with them and working with simultaneous three-dimensional navigation. The surgical team was interviewed by ADN radio.[32]In January 2014, Indian Orthopedic Surgeon Selene G. Parekh conducted the foot and ankle surgery using Google Glass inJaipur, which was broadcast live on Google website via the internet. The surgery was held during a three-day annual Indo-US conference attended by a team of experts from the US and co-organized byAshish Sharma. Sharma said Google Glass allows looking at an X-Ray or MRI without taking the eye off of the patient and allows a doctor to communicate with a patient\\'s family or friends during a procedure.Baby Eve with Georgia for the Breastfeeding Support ProjectInAustralia, during January 2014,Melbournetech startupSmall World Socialcollaborated with theAustralian Breastfeeding Associationto create the first hands-free breastfeedingGoogle Glassapplication for new mothers.[33]The application, namedGoogle Glass Breastfeeding app trial, allows mothers to nurse their baby while viewing instructions about common breastfeeding issues (latching on, posture etc.) or call a lactation consultant via a secure Google Hangout, who can view the issue through the mother\\'s Google Glass camera.[34]The trial was successfully concluded inMelbournein April 2014, and 100% of participants were breastfeeding confidently.[35][36]Display types[edit]Various techniques have existed forsee-throughHMDs. Most of these techniques can be summarized into two main families: \"Curved Mirror\" (or Curved Combiner) based and \"Waveguide\" or \"Light-guide\" based. The mirror technique has been used inEyeTaps, byMetain theirMeta 1, byVuzixin their Star 1200 product, byOlympus, and by Laster Technologies.Various waveguide techniques have existed for some time. These techniques include diffraction optics, holographic optics, polarized optics, reflective optics, and projection:Diffractive waveguide – slanted diffraction grating elements (nanometric 10E-9).Nokiatechnique now licensed to Vuzix.Holographic waveguide – 3holographic optical elements(HOE) sandwiched together (RGB). Used bySonyandKonica Minolta.Reflective waveguide – A thick light guide with single semi-reflective mirror is used byEpsonin their Moverio product. A curved light guide with partial-reflective segmented mirror array to out-couple the light is used bytooz technologies GmbH.[37]Virtual retinal display(VRD) – Also known as a retinal scan display (RSD) or retinal projector (RP), is a display technology that draws arasterdisplay (like atelevision) directly onto theretinaof the eye - developed by MicroVision, Inc.[38]TheTechnical IllusionscastARuses a different technique with clear glass.  The glasses have a projector, and the image is returned to the eye by a reflective surface.Lastly, there is a technique more popular with hobbyists due to its low cost which requires using amagnifyinglens to focus the screen onto the eye.[39]Smart sunglasses[edit]Smart sunglasses which are able to change their light filtering properties at runtime generally use liquid crystal technology. As lighting conditions change, for example when the user goes from indoors to outdoors, the brightness ratio also changes and can cause undesirable vision impairment. An attractive solution for overcoming this issue is to incorporate dimming filters into smart sunglasses which control the amount of ambient light reaching the eye. An innovative liquid crystal based component for use in the lenses of smart sunglasses is PolarView[40]by LC-Tec.[41]PolarView offers analog dimming control, with the level of dimming being adjusted by an applied drive voltage.Another type of smart sunglasses uses adaptive polarization filtering (ADF). ADF-type smart sunglasses can change their polarization filtering characteristics at runtime. For example, ADF-type smart sunglasses can change from horizontal polarization filtering to vertical polarization filtering at the touch of a button.The lenses of smart sunglasses can be manufactured out of multiple adaptive cells, therefore different parts of the lens can exhibit different optical properties. For example, the top of the lens can be electronically configured to have different polarization filter characteristics and different opacity than the lower part of the lens.[42]Human–computer interface control input[edit]Head-mounted displays are not designed to be workstations, and traditional input devices such as keyboard and mouse do not support the concept of smartglasses. Insteadhuman–computer interface(HCI) control input needs to be methods lend themselves to mobility and/or hands-free use are good candidates, for example:Touchpadorpush-buttonsCompatible devices (e.g.smartphones,smartwatches,smart rings, control unit, ormotion controllers) for remote controlSpeech recognitionGesture recognition[43]andhand trackingEye trackingBrain–computer interfaceHead tracking (as fallback)Notable products[edit]In development[edit]Xiaomi Smart Glasses byXiaomi– wearable AR device[44]b.g.

While these were specified as analog transformation devices, today they are amenable for digital application in many smartglasses. see:Experimental model for the study of changes in the organization of human sensory information processing through the design and testing of non-invasive prosthetic devices for sensory impaired people2012[edit]On 17 April 2012,Oakley\\'s CEO Colin Baden stated that the company has been working on a way to project information directly onto lenses since 1997, and has 600 patents related to the technology, many of which apply to optical specifications.[56]On 18 June 2012,Canonannounced the MR (Mixed Reality) System which simultaneously merges virtual objects with the real world at full scale and in 3D. Unlike the Google Glass, the MR System is aimed for professional use with a price tag for the headset and accompanying system is $125,000, with $25,000 in expected annual maintenance.[57]2013[edit]AtMWC2013, the Japanese company Brilliant Service introduced the Viking OS, an operating system for HMD\\'s which was written inObjective-Cand relies on gesture control as a primary form of input. It includes afacial recognition systemand was demonstrated on a revamped version of Vuzix STAR 1200XL glasses ($4,999) which combined a generic RGB camera and a PMD CamBoard nano depth camera.[58]AtMaker Faire2013, the startup company Technical Illusions unveiled CastAR augmented reality glasses which are well equipped for an AR experience: infraredLEDson the surface detect the motion of an interactive infrared wand, and a set of coils at its base are used to detect RFID chip loaded objects placed on top of it; it uses dual projectors at a frame rate of 120\\xa0Hz and a retro-reflective screen providing a 3D image that can be seen from all directions by the user; a camera sitting on top of the prototype glasses is incorporated for position detection, thus the virtual image changes accordingly as a user walks around the CastAR surface.[59]AtD11 Conference2013, the startup company Atheer Labs unveiled its 3D augmented reality glasses prototype. The prototype includes binocular lens, 3D images support, a rechargeable battery, WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, accelerometer, gyro and an IR. User can interact with the device by voice commands and the mounted camera allows the users to interact naturally with the device with gestures.[60]2014[edit]The Orlando Magic, Indiana Pacers, and otherNBAteams used Google Glass on theCrowdOpticplatform to enhance the in-game experience for fans.[61]Rhode Island Hospital\\'s Emergency Department became the first emergency department to experiment with Google Glass applications.[62]2018[edit]Intelannounces Vaunt, a set of smart glasses that are designed to appear like conventional glasses and are display-only, usingretinal projection.[63]The project was later shut down.[64]ZeissandDeutsche Telekompartners up to formtooz technologies GmbHto develop optical elements for smart glass displays.[65][66]2021[edit]Facebook Reality LabsandRay-Banannounced a collaboration project calledRay-Ban Stories.  Unlike previous smart glasses by other companies, Ray-Ban Stories have no HUD or AR display but have integrated cameras, speakers, and microphones running through aQualcomm Snapdragonprocessor and connect viabluetoothto integrate withFacebookon your phone.[67]Market structure[edit]Analytics company IHS has estimated that the shipments of smart glasses may rise from just 50,000 units in 2012 to as high as 6.6 million units in 2016.[68]According to a survey of more than 4,600 U.S. adults conducted byForrester Research, around 12 percent of respondents are willing to wear Google Glass or other similar devices if it offers a service that piques their interest.[69]Business Insider\\'s BI Intelligence expects an annual sales of 21 millionGoogle Glassunits by 2018.[70][71][72]Samsung and Microsoft are expected to develop their own version of Google Glass within six months with a price range of $200 to $500. Samsung has reportedly bought lenses from Lumus, a company based in Israel. Another source says Microsoft is negotiating with Vuzix.[73]In 2006,Applefiled patent for its own HMD device.[74]In July 2013, APX Labs founder and CEO Brian Ballard stated that he knows of 25 to 30 hardware companies which are working on their own versions of smartglasses, some of which APX is working with.[75]Reception for commercial usage[edit]In November 2012,Google Glassreceived recognition byTimeMagazineas one of the \"Best Inventions of the Year 2012\", alongside inventions such as theCuriosity Rover.[76]John Naughton praised the Google Glass and compared it with the achievements of hardware and networking pioneerDouglas Engelbart. Naughton wrote that Engelbart believed that machines \"should do what machines do best, thereby freeing up humans to do whattheydo best\".[77]Lisa A. Goldstein, a freelance journalist, published a review on 6 August 2013, which stated that Google Glass does not accommodate hearing aids and is not suitable for people who cannot understand speech. Goldstein also explained the limited options for customer support, as telephone contact was her only means of communication.[78]In December 2013,David Datunabecame the first artist to incorporate Google Glass into a contemporary work of art.[79][80]The artwork debuted at a private event at The New World Symphony in Miami Beach, Florida, US and was moved to the Miami Design District for the public debut.[81]Over 1500 people used Google Glass to experience Datuna\\'s American flag from his \"Viewpoint of Billions\" series.[82]After a negative public reaction, the retail availability of Google Glass ended in January 2015, and the company moved to focus on business customers in 2017.Privacy concerns[edit]TheEyeTap\\'s functionality and minimalist appearance have been compared toSteve Mann\\'s EyeTap,[83]also known as \"Glass\" or \"Digital Eye Glass\", although Google Glass is a \"Generation-1 Glass\" compared to EyeTap, which is a \"Generation-4 Glass\".[84]According to Mann, both devices affect bothprivacyandsecrecyby introducing a two-sidedsurveillanceandsousveillance.[85]Concerns have been raised by various sources regarding the intrusion of privacy, and theetiquetteandethicsof using the device in public and recording people without their permission.[86][87][88]There is controversy that Google Glass would violate privacy rights due to security problems and others.[89][90][91]Privacy advocates are concerned that people wearing such eyewear may be able to identify strangers in public using facial recognition, or surreptitiously record and broadcast private conversations.[8]Some companies in the U.S. have posted anti-Google Glass signs in their establishments.[92][93]In July 2013, prior to the official release of the product, Stephen Balaban, co-founder of software company Lambda Labs, circumvented Google\\'s facial recognition app block by building his own, non-Google-approved operating system. Balaban then installed face-scanning Glassware that creates a summary of commonalities shared by the scanned person and the Glass wearer, such as mutual friends and interests.[94]Additionally, Michael DiGiovanni created Winky, a program that allows a Google Glass user to take a photo with a wink of an eye, while Marc Rogers, a principal security researcher at Lookout, discovered that Glass can be hijacked if a user could be tricked into taking a picture of a malicious QR code.[95][96]Other concerns have been raised regarding legality of Google Glass in a number of countries, particularly in Russia, Ukraine, and other post-USSR countries. In February 2013, a Google+ user noticed legal issues with Google Glass and posted in the Google Glass community about the issues, stating that the device may be illegal to use according to the current legislation in Russia and Ukraine, which prohibits use of spy gadgets that can record video, audio or take photographs in an inconspicuous manner.[97]Concerns were also raised in regard to the privacy and security of Google Glass users in the event that the device is stolen or lost, an issue that was raised by a US congressional committee. As part of its response to the governmental committee, Google stated in early July that is working on a locking system and raising awareness of the ability of users to remotely reset Google Glass from the web interface in the event of loss. Several facilities have banned the use of Google Glass before its release to the general public, citing concerns over potential privacy-violating capabilities. Other facilities, such asLas Vegascasinos, banned Google Glass, citing their desire to comply with Nevada state law and common gaming regulations which ban the use of recording devices near gambling areas.[98]Safety[edit]Concerns have also been raised on operating motor vehicles while wearing the device. On 31 July 2013 it was reported that driving while wearing Google Glass is likely to be banned in the UK, being deemed careless driving, therefore a fixed penalty offense, following a decision by theDepartment for Transport.[99]In the U.S.,West Virginiastate representativeGary G. Howellintroduced an amendment in March 2013 to the state\\'s law against texting while driving that would include bans against \"using a wearable computer with head mounted display.\" In an interview, Howell stated, \"The primary thing is a safety concern, it [the glass headset] could project text or video into your field of vision. I think there\\'s a lot of potential for distraction.\"[100]In October 2013, a driver inCaliforniawas ticketed for \"driving with monitor visible to driver (Google Glass)\" after being pulled over for speeding by aSan Diego Police Departmentofficer. The driver was reportedly the first to be ticketed for driving while wearing a Google Glass.[101]While the judge noted that \\'Google Glass fell under \"the purview and intent\" of the ban on driving with a monitor\\', the case was thrown out of court due to lack of proof the device was on at the time.[102]See also[edit]Head-mounted displayWearable technologyQuantified selfBionic contact lensReferences[edit]^abIEEE Spectrum, \"Vision 2.0\" IEEE Spectrum, Volume 50, Issue 3, Digital Object Identifier: 10.1109/MSPEC.2013.6471058, pp\\xa042-47^Wearable Computing: A First Step Toward Personal Imaging, IEEE Computer, Vol. 30, Iss. 2 Feb. 1997, pp. 25–32,^\"Quantigraphic camera promises HDR eyesight from Father of AR\", Chris Davies, Slashgear, 12 September 2012^\"Smart eyewear - LC-Tec\".LC-Tec(in Swedish).

Nearly nine decades after the Hindenburg disaster, some speculate we’re entering the Second Age of the Balloon. “As all these objects fall, a new space race is rising,” Vox (https://www.vox.com/world/2023/2/7/23588464/suspect-spy-china-balloon-sputnik-moment-space-race) proclaimed. Tens of thousands of balloons float into near-space every year, and the numbers rise every year. The National Weather Service alone launches around 60k high-flying balloons each year. The Pentagon spent nearly $4B over the past two years on its own high altitude balloons, according to Politico (https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/05/u-s-militarys-newest-weapon-against-china-and-russia-hot-air-00043860). Why the interest in such old-school tech? “They’re cheap, easy to transport, can be fielded in large numbers and are payload agnostic,” industry expert George Howell wrote. Tucson, Arizona-based World View (https://spacenews.com/world-view-emphasizes-remote-sensing-as-it-prepares-to-go-public/), a stratospheric ballooning company, last month announced plans to go public via SPAC merger.

Colorado-based Urban Sky (/company/urban-sky) is creating what it claims as the first ever reusable stratospheric balloon. Called “micro-balloons,” they’re the size of a VW bus and can hover in near space to collect data over urban areas. Company founder Jared Leidich (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/04_fm2017-alan-eustaces-jump-1-180961678/) has some chops in this arena, having designed the space suit used in the world record space dive in 2014 via a balloon at nearly 136k feet. Near Space Labs (/company/nearspacelabs) invites people to “step inside a new way of thinking about all things geospatial imaging (https://nearspacelabs.com/blog/).” The company's high-altitude balloons that carry a small, autonomous robot called Swifty to capture the world around them at 60k to 85k feet in the air. The company says it’s done zero carbon emissions and recently launched (https://www.zdnet.com/article/near-space-labs-provide-free-high-resolution-imagery-to-universities-nonprofits/) a program to make its high-resolution Earth imagery available to universities and nonprofits for free. Sounds fascinating, right? Luckily, with a new wave of space technology, comes a brand new, cutting-edge wave of jobs. Check out 5 top startups aiming skywards and hiring now.\",\n",

I mean, don’t get me wrong, the technology is incredibly cool, but everyone seems to be talking about it!That is why, I want to talk about tracking your fitness and activities.When it comes to fitness, I tend to keep track of it as well as my health through the default Apple Health and Workout apps, which are actually rather good.A few weeks ago, I was on a cycle ride in the British countryside with a few friends, and they all had fitness bands. From memory, one friend had a Xiaomi Mi Smart Band and the others had a Fitbit.That got me thinking, the Apple Health apps are pretty good, so, wouldn’t it be great if Apple released a slightly cheaper activity tracker primarily aimed at tracking fitness instead of the smart features?Do people still use fitness bands?Before we get any further in this article, we have to ask ourselves a question, do people still use fitness bands?I mean, I can name a few friends who do, but a few friends is hardly a good answer, So let’s have a look at the current market, starting with Fitbit.Fitbit is a veteran when it comes to fitness trackers, they have been around for a long time and I remember owning a few models such as the Fitbit Blaze and Fitbit Charge 2.Fitbit now produces smartwatches, and it looks like their primary focus has shifted to theGoogle Pixel Watch, which by the way is an excellent watch!But they are also promoting the Fitbit Charge 6 which looks like a pretty decent fitness tracker.Fitbit isn’t the only brand that manufactures’ fitness trackers, there are many to choose from, and they don’t have to be expensive either!But should Apple release a fitness band?We’ve established that fitness trackers are still available on the market, but are they still popular?Anarticle from The Verge, dated back to August 2023, suggests that they are on a decline and that they are unlikely to make a comeback and looking at other sources, it appears to be correct.In all fairness, we don’t have to look far, believe it or not, even Samsung seems to have stopped making fitness trackers. I was once the proud owner of a Samsung Galaxy Fit 3, but they only seem to make smartwatches now.But with all that in mind, Fitbit, Xiaomi, Amazfit, Huawei and multiple other brands still sell fitness bands and I don’t think they would be making them if people weren’t buying them.The truth of the matter is that fitness bands have dropped in popularity, but I still see plenty of people out in public using them. So, maybe if a brand with a lot of potential and influence releases one (I’m looking at you Apple), they will gain popularity again?ConclusionI think it would be great if Apple released a purpose-built fitness tracker, it would be even better if they combined it with wellness technology to help people track sleep, recovery and strain, a bit like a Whoop.However, I don’t think it’s in Apple’s interest to release one. I mean, you can buy a new Apple Watch SE for around £219, that’s around the price of a Fitbit Sense 2.Moreover, when I used to work in an electronics store, I remember the Fitbit Charge 2 costing around £150, the current model costs £139, which isn’t far off.As an owner of an Apple Watch SE, I think that it’s brilliant as a smartwatch and a fitness tracker.That is why, overall, I think the fitness band market is a niche market that is slowly moving on to smartwatches. I mean, traditional fitness tracker bands, such as Fitbit and Garmin, wouldn’t be making fitness watches if it wasn’t right?That is why, I don’t think Apple should release a fitness tracker, but if they do decide to release one, it may potentially influence other brands to release more in the future.What are your thoughts on this?

       "   \"In today's Finshots we talk about smartwatches, wireless earphones and Apple's place in all of this.BusinessThe StoryWearables have changed the way we interact with technology. Fitness trackers, smartwatches, wireless headphones\\u200a—\\u200aThese were items that were once fashionable only among a select group of people. Today, however, they have gained mainstream acceptance. And for tech companies, this is a moment of reckoning. Because “wearables” isn’t just a fringe domain anymore. It’s a multi-billion dollar industry rife for disruption.Think about it\\u200a—\\u200aThere was a time when smartphones made all the money. But today, they’re just commodities. You can’t tell one phone from another. And the market seems to be saturating. But people are only just getting into wearables and that means the growth potential is huge right now.However, one company seems to be dominating everyone else. And it’s the usual suspect\\u200a—\\u200aApple.Apple is miles ahead of everyone else. So far in the first quarter of 2021, Apple has had a global market share of28.8%followed by Samsung which only has an 11% share to its name. Then we have Xiaomi with 9.7%, Huawei with 8.2% and finally, India’s BoAt makes an appearance with a respectable 2.9% market share.In fact, some estimates suggest that the wearables segment at Apple alone could be worth a mammoth$30 billion. If this division was spun off as a different entity, it would feature amongst the Fortune 100 companies. And it’s not like this happened overnight. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a result of careful planning and an unparalleled understanding of human psychology.Unlike phones, wearables have to be worn. And people must crave to show them off. It’s a style statement, and if you can’t fashion something that fits this criterion, then that’s a no-go. Apple has nailed this aspect. When Apple introduced the Apple Watch, there was considerable scepticism about the utility of such a product. Some critics even lambasted the first generation for being a let-down.But ask yourself this\\u200a—\\u200aWhy do people wear a watch in the first place?It’s an accessory that boosts your style quotient. Sure, it also helps you keep time. But watches\\u200a—\\u200aThey enhance appearance. They are no longer just functional products. They have transcended their utility. So the Apple Watch never had to be functionally superior. It simply had to be aesthetically pleasing. Which it was! In fact, Apple wasn’t even competing with other smartwatch manufacturers. They were competing with watchmakers, period. And today they sellmore watchesthan the entire Swiss watch industry combined.The product itself meanwhile is no slouch either. It has a whole bunch of nifty features and it pairs with other Apple products rather seamlessly. And this ability to integrate wearables with their massive product ecosystem offers them an extra edge. In fact, this integration aspect goes beyond just Apple products. These guys have the leverage to seamlessly integrate with multiple product partners out there.Yeah, not many people can say no to Apple, can they?And the Watch is just one product within the company’s stable. You also have the ultra-popular AirPods\\u200a—\\u200awireless earphones that have caught the world by storm. Unlike the Apple Watch, which struggled to claim mainstream acceptance in the early days, AirPods were a runaway success from the get-go. For Millennials and Gen-Z, this was a status symbol like no other. And while it did have its fair share of detractors, AirPods changed the game altogether. Headphone jacks are now facing an existential crisis like never before and all of Apple’s competitors are introducing earphones that look and feel pretty similar to AirPods.Bottom line\\u200a—\\u200aApple has nailed the hardware game once again. And if they keep this up, they’ll continue to dominate another multi-billion industry, once again.Until then…Don't forget to share this article onWhatsApp,LinkedInandTwitter\",\n",

More than 180 million wearables were shipped worldwide in 2022, most of which were some form of smartwatch, said Canalys.Healthcare and fitness uses in smartwatches in recent times have catapulted the popularity of these devices. They are an extension of the mobile phone and monitor a plethora of readings, from a user’s heart rate to his location and even how well he sleeps.Wearables are appealing because they offer personalised readings of the user’s health, said Professor Lim Chwee Teck from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Institute for Health Innovation and Technology.He is one of many experts at the university who are developing wearable-related technology, includingstretchy electrical circuitsthatpatch themselveswhen torn by oozing out liquid metal, and sensors that track movement during rehabilitation, which will allow users to monitor their own progress.Prof Lim said wearablesoffer the unprecedented potentialof continuously monitoring vital signs and other personal readings.This capability presents a treasure trove of data for healthcare professionals to provide customers and for the development of new tools powered by artificial intelligence (AI), which will need a sizeable pool of data to work reliably, he said.“The saying is ‘there is no AI without data’, but there is also no data without technology to collect it. That is why wearable technology is so promising to our field,” said Prof Lim.Innovators have been pushing watches to do more since the early days of all-electric digital watches, pioneered by the Hamilton Watch Company in the 1970s.In the 1980s, Seiko crammed a mini-television into a watch display, and in the 1990s, inventor Steve Mann – the “father of wearable computing” – built a watch that could receive messages wirelessly with computers.Soon, early models of wearables with fitness trackers, like those from Garmin, Nike and Pebble, grew in popularity.In Singapore, the smartwatch market has been relatively stable, with around 750,000 units sold each year between 2020 and 2022, said global market intelligence firm IDC.The sales of smartwatches here have been driven largely by health and fitness users, while national movements like those organised by the Health Promotion Board have raised awareness ofsuch devices.The market forsouped-up wristwatches and other wearables hasdrawn the attention of tech manufacturers such as Samsung, Apple and Google, which have integrated the watches into their ecosystem of electronics.Samsung is working with various public-sector organisations and enterprises here to support work and explore new applications, Mr Timothy Tan, Samsung Singapore’s head of enterprise and government business, told The Straits Times.More on this TopicWhy runners are swallowing electronic pills to help build next-generation wearablesI ditched my smartwatch, and I don't regret itSome hospitals are exploring them as a notification system for medical professionals, whomight not always have their hands free to check their phones for alerts, said Mr Tan.Some hotels are considering equipping chambermaids with wearables to allow them to quickly alert their colleagues to mishaps or assaults within the hotel, he added.Looking to the future, experts said wearables are unlikely to retain the form they hold today.NUS Heat Resilience and Performance Centre director Jason Lee believes manufacturers will mash up more sensors within a single device to perform more uses.The centre’s research into how people’s core temperature correlates to their skin temperature mayone day help smartwatches accurately estimate if a user is overheating.Prof Lim said sensors on wearableswill evolve to blend into clothing, furniture and other items used dailyin order to appeal to,say, those who do not want to wear a device.But to win the trust of the masses, companies also need to be clear about where data is stored and how it is used.“The data collected from wearables and other smart devices is often handled by many groups, and how users will retain privacy and their rights to their own data is something that the industry is still figuring out,” said Prof Lim.More on this TopicWearable 'Ai Pin' launched by Humane, backed by ex-Apple execs and MicrosoftDo we need a wearable air purifier in Singapore?JoinST's Telegram channeland get the latest breaking news delivered to you.SmartwatchesTechnology sectorInnovationFitness gadgetsThanks for sharing!\",\n",

Propelling the market higher will be devices like the Apple Watch, along with other smartwatches like Motorola\\'s Moto 360, and Samsung\\'s Gear watches. Wrist-worn wearables, including bands, bracelets, and watches, will account for more than 80% of the market over the coming years, IDC said. But it also sees strong growth in smart clothing -- shirts, socks, hats, and other products with computing power -- along with connected eyewear and earwear. \"Smart wearables are about to take a major step forward with the launch of the Apple Watch this year,\" said IDC analyst Ramon Llamas. \"The Apple Watch raises the profile of wearables in general and there are many vendors and devices that are eager to share the spotlight. Basic wearables, meanwhile, will not disappear. In fact, we anticipate continued growth here as many segments of the market seek out simple, single-use wearable devices.\" IDC analyst Ryan Reith said that fitness bands, the early leader in wearables, have come down in price and are now being bundled with smartphones at little cost. \"The explosion of wearable devices was clearly led by fitness bands, which until recently commanded prices that provided comfortable margins, but those days are changing,\" he said \"The market is quickly shifting toward higher-priced devices that offer greater functionality.\" IDC said it sees \"smart wearables\" with the ability to run outside applications grow 510% this year to 25.7 million units, while \"basic\" wearables will grow some 30% to 20 million units.

       "   \"AppleThe Apple Watch made smartwatches the wearable of choiceIt’s been ten years since the Apple Watch was announced. Where does it go from here?ByVictoria Song,a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 12 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.Sep 8, 2024, 12:00 PM UTCShare this storyThreadsThe first Apple Watch was announced on September 9th, 2014. A decade later, it’s the most popular smartwatch in the world.Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The VergeTen years ago, after announcing theiPhone 6, Tim Cook had one more thing to show the world. Cue the first-ever sizzle reel for the Apple Watch.It’s funnywatching that videotoday, especially when you zero in on the features Apple claimed would revolutionize the smartwatch category. There was the Digital Crown — a so-called breakthrough in input technology that would let you scroll and zoom on what was essentially a mini wrist computer. It had a Taptic Engine that would discreetly buzz when a text or notification came in. Glances were supposed to be digestible tidbits of information, a sort of status update for your apps. Also, remember Digital Touch? That weird feature where you press two fingers on the screen and send a friend an animation of your heartbeat?Let’s not forget the 18K gold, $10,000Apple Watch Edition.RelatedApple Watch: the definitive reviewFast forward a decade, and the sizzle reels for the Apple Watch are completely different. Now, they’re full of people sharing stories about how the Apple Watch saved their lives. Year after year, most of the new features focus on novel ways to close your rings. Whatever you think of the Apple Watch, it’s now the most popular smartwatch in the world and has been for years. In 2020, itoutsold the entirety of the Swiss watch industry. It is an undeniable success. But 10 years in, where does the Apple Watch go next?The first Apple Watch arrived during the golden age of the fitness tracker.Fitbitsand devices like theJawbone Upreigned supreme with their long battery life and simplicity. Smartwatches kind of sucked. Pebble was beloved for its simplicity among gadget nerds, but the company never achieved mainstream appeal. Google was next to the scene with Android Wear in 2014, but as a platform, it was plagued by laggy interfaces, questionable tracking accuracy, bulky form factors, and piddling battery life. Samsung had a few options on its Tizen OS, but it struggled with many of the same issues. So didthe first Apple Watch. For most people, the smartwatch was an overly expensive device that couldn’t replace a fitness tracker or your smartphone. So, what was the point in buying one?Nobody had a good answer, including Apple (which is probably why so much of the Apple Watch’s early marketing focused on fashion, of all things). And it wouldn’t start figuring out the answer until 2017.The Series 4 changed the entire playing field.Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The VergeThat’s when Apple added LTE with theSeries 3. Suddenly, the Apple Watch wasn’t tethered to your phone. You could still call for help in an emergency. I remember calling my roommate to give myself the illusion of safety while freaked out on a walk. Safety was a persuasive argument, albeit one tempered by still laggy performance. It certainly didn’t help that making that call absolutely zapped my battery life in a mere 30 minutes. After I finished testing the Series 3, I went back to myFitbit Alta HR— but my perception of the device as an unnecessary luxury had shifted.And then the real industrywide game changer came in 2018 with theSeries 4. Now the Apple Watch had FDA-cleared EKGs that could detect atrial fibrillation. It could figure out when you had a hard fall and call for help on your behalf. On top of that, you could get alerted if your heart rate abnormally spiked when it shouldn’t. Your phone can’t do that. Suddenly, the Apple Watch wasn’t a fancy toy that, at best, helped triage notifications. It could save lives. And did.It turns out, health is what’ll get the average person to buy a smartwatch. Anecdotally, it’s the number one reason why friends and family ask me about smartwatches. I’ll get texts from folks worried about their parents’ health or, as we get older, concerned friends following a less-than-stellar doctor’s visit. It’s why I personally made the switch, too. It’s why it’sso hard to find anyone making fitness bandsanymore.The only problem is that tech moves fast. Health is notoriously slow.The Apple Watch has gotten more clever updates than I can count. So many thatthe Series 9, Ultra 2,andsecond-gen SEare vastly different devices than the original watch. (I, for one, am a big fan of last year’sdouble tap gesture.) But even the most ardent Apple Watch fans can’t deny the updates feel more iterative with each passing year. Aside from introducing the Ultra in 2022, there hasn’t been an industry-shaking update since the Series 4.Not for lack of trying. There have been several rumors that Apple’s been working on features likehigh blood pressureandsleep apnea detection, plus the holy grail of all health tech,noninvasive blood glucose monitoring. But the raison d’être that catapulted the smartwatch — the fact that it can save lives — is also the very thing that’s kept it in limbo. If people believe this tech can save lives, it has to pass a higher regulatory bar than any other consumer gadget.Even the most ardent Apple Watch fans can’t deny the updates feel more iterative with each passing yearThis is a good thing! FDA clearance is there to protect consumers and ensure guardrails are in place. But it does mean Apple is kind of stuck. For better or worse, it set consumer expectations sky-high in this space. Yet, advanced health features require companies to tread the thin line between regulatory clearance, accuracy, and patents. All this takes an incredible amount of resources and time. (You need look no further thanApple’s legal battle with medical device maker Masimo over blood oxygen techto see why Samsung beat Apple to anFDA-cleared sleep apnea feature.)In essence, the Apple Watch is sort of where the iPhone was a few years ago — solid, but minor updates with the vague sense that something big might be around the corner. But where generative AI has breathed new life into smartphones, no one’s figured out how best to stuff it into a smartwatch yet. Based on what we saw at WWDC, Apple Intelligence isn’t headed for the Watch anytime soon, either. So, where does that leave the Apple Watch over the next decade?There’s always a chance that Apple will pull an industry-first health feature out of thin air. Just a few days ago,Bloombergand9to5Macboth reported the long-delayed sleep apnea feature might make an appearance. But without health, Apple has to go the more traditional route. Bigger screens. Better battery life. Upgraded sensors. More in-depth fitness features to compete with the likes of Garmin, Polar, and Suunto. More ways to integrate with other Apple devices. New, non-health ways to make your life better. Apple’s in a tricky spot, but in the case of the EKG, it was worth the wait. The next time Tim Cook steps out onstage might not be to show off technology that saves your life, but give it time.CommentsMost PopularMost PopularTikTok isn’t back in the App Store yetMarvel Snap is banned, just like TikTokTikTok is partially back online in the US, but it’s not back in the App Store yetTikTok shuts down in the USInstagram announces a blatant CapCut cloneVerge Deals/Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.From our sponsorAdvertiser Content From\"],\n",

The term encompasses a whole bunch of cutting-edge technologies that are making real-time medical monitoring and treatment more effective and comfortable than ever. Integrating AI, telemedicine, and sensor-based technologies, some developments are more sci-fi and surprising than others. Innovation insensor technologyis transforming the world of wearable IVDs and medical devices. Strides in miniaturisation, IoT and AI are making real-time tracking, diagnosis and treatment possible in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago. 'Smart clothes' and headsets, single-use patches and other appendages are among a host of innovations that are being made possible by smaller, thinner and more capable MEMS and MOEMS. MEMS are the sensors that measure physical properties or chemical changes within their surrounding environment, such as temperature, acceleration and pressure.MOEMS are Micro-Opto-Electro-Mechanical Systems, that use optics for imaging, measurement and actuation. Common types of sensors include accelerometers, pressure gauges (which measure force), flow meters (which measure fluid flow), and gyroscopes (which measure angular velocity). This technology is getting smaller than ever. MEMS can range from several mm to an impossibly small size: less than 1 micrometre or 1000 of a millimetre. At this size, it is not even visible to the human eye. At the same time, new materials, coatings, and finishes ensure they are becoming safer and more comfortable for use in intimate, bodily settings. What’s more, their extraordinary sensitivity and capacity for data capture and actuation continue to grow, making hyper-personalised healthcare possible, even outside practice or clinic walls. Sensors used to measure and track specific bodily functions like muscle and brain activity includeElectromyographic (EMG)andElectroencephalographic (EEG)based MEMs. Meanwhile,cMUTs (Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers)are paving the way for wearables that can transmit images of organs and even the inside of veins and blood vessels. Next-generation ultrasound transducers developed byresearchers in Canadathat can be integrated into adhesive patches the size of postage stamps, makingremote ultrasound procedures, among other things, possible. Their potential for ‘mass-fabrication and versatile integration’ will make preventive, real-time medical monitoring for otherwise invisible conditions easier and cheaper than ever before. Telemedicine has revolutionised healthcare delivery by democratising healthcare worldwide. It removes geographical barriers and enables remote consultation, diagnosis, and treatment. Integrating telemedicine with wearable devices and cloud-based platforms supports real-time diagnostics, continuous monitoring, and immediate feedback, ensuring patients receive timely interventions without visiting a clinic. And as sensor technologies evolve, telemedicine will become increasingly personalised and predictive. Here are 13 of the most innovative wearable medical device companies transforming healthcare that we’ve spotted out in the market and at trade shows likeMEDICAandCOMPAMED: Long recognised as a healthcare company,Philipsoffers an extensive range of healthcare solutions, ranging from MRI scanners to electric toothbrushes. Its wearable biosensors are designed for continuous patient monitoring and tracking vital signs such as heart and respiratory rate, facilitating early detection of patient deterioration for timely interventions.

With expertise in medical imaging, diagnostics, patient monitoring systems, drug discovery, and performance improvement solutions,GE HealthCareoffers wearable devices that monitor vital signs and other health metrics. These wearables are designed to seamlessly integrate with hospital systems, providing real-time data to healthcare providers and enhancing patient care. Invizahas created innovative tracking insoles designed for remote patient monitoring. These insoles seamlessly integrate into footwear and establish automatic connections with smartphones. Individuals can access real-time fitness and location biometric analytics by wearing these insoles while walking, skipping, or running. H-Cube, an Italian startup, has developed an advanced product called H-Tee, specifically designed for athletes. This smart t-shirt incorporates cutting-edge technology, including contactless electrodes and batteries, to extract various vital signs such as cardiac variability, heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory rate. ABIORO, a Brazilian startup, is focused on revolutionising cardiac event monitoring with its Abioro RX Patch. This wearable patch is a practical alternative to traditional holter monitors, delivering an ergonomic and comfortable experience. By leveraging bio-sensing and deep learning technologies, the Abioro RX Patch accurately diagnoses cardiac arrhythmia, providing doctors with reliable data for remote patient monitoring. EMOTIVis a company developing EEG (Electroencephalogram) tech for business and medical use. Using sensors integrated into headsets, the technology gathers information about an individual's brain activity for insight into emotional states and cognitive responses triggered by external stimuli.\\xa0 Headsets are sold to academic researchers and even marketers who want insight into consumer reactions to products and adverts: EMOTIV’s portable EEG headsets measure brainwaves with millisecond accuracy — providing real insights into how someone feels about your products or media. The technology is currently being explored for its potential to help those with neurodegenerative diseases control devices and communicate through apps by the power of their thoughts alone. Imago Rehabhas developed a soft robotic glove to support medical rehabilitation in stroke patients.\\xa0 It incorporates sensors to help patients exercise weak limbs properly, with MEMs being used to\\xa0 monitor and support delicate muscle responses: To make the glove comfortable and natural feeling to wearers, the actuators powering the movements of the glove were made smaller and modified over several iterations of design to distribute forces more evenly over the wearer’s fingers and thumb. IoT ensures data about improvements in muscle performance can be relayed in real-time to physios, who can then make remote adjustments to exercise regimes via the gloves. Medtronichave developed their MiniMed™ 780G System, as the next phase in their artificial pancreas development for Type 1 Diabetics. The hybrid closed loop (HCL) system uses biosensor patches to keep track of glucose levels and actuates insulin delivery as required. The design incorporates meal detection technology that automatically adjusts and corrects sugar levels every 5 minutes. DFreeis developing support products for urinary incontinence. It uses a non-invasive sensor attached to patients’ bodies to support incontinence management around the clock. The product uses ultrasound technology to detect when the bladder is full and notify patients, via an app, when they need to urinate. A team at the University of California in San Diego, has pioneered asingle, wireless ultrasound adhesive patchthat can monitor blood pressure, heart health, and lung capacity in real-time: The credit-card-size ultrasound patch can monitor signals from tissues as deep as 16 centimetres under the skin. It can continuously measure blood pressure, heart output, respiratory health, and other physiological signals for up to 12 hours on a single charge. Researchers and entrepreneurs are exploring new possibilities for wearable medical devices. But commercial, regulatory and practical pressures can easily stop novel ideas from being realised. Dealing with the complexities of building devices that are comfortable, efficacious, and viable is one thing. Meeting all the FDA requirements for testing and proving the safety of ‘novel’ medical products is another. Moving from ideation to development can take more than 7 years, clinical trials can take between 1 and 3 years, andPMA approval from the FDA for bleeding-edge devicescan take more than 3 years to achieve. Don’t forget Apple’s iWatch was released with huge fanfare in 2015, hailed for its potential to transform preventive medicine, but was not then approved as ‘a medical device’ by the FDA.\\xa0 \\xa0The leap from a fitness or wellbeing device to a medical-grade diagnostic tool is huge. Companies wanting to bring their wearable innovation to a medical market must ensure their devices are built to the highest possible safety standards while remaining commercially viable. To achieve this, designers and developers must collaborate with manufacturers with the experience and facilities todeliver at scale in the medical device sector.They will need access to complex supply chains, specialist components and highly skilled labour. They’ll need to ensure the microscopic MEMs and MOEMs they require are produced to exacting FDA standards but can still be manufactured at the required scale.\\xa0\\xa0Many will need tovalue engineertheir approach and applyDFX (Design for Excellence) techniquesto achieve the dream of wearable medical devices for all.

       "  'content': [\"Find out what happened in the markets today – and why you should care – with the free Daily Brief newsletter. In the eighteen years since it was founded in 2003 by a small group of engineers, America’sTeslahas gone from underdog champion of niche electric vehicle (EV) design to market leader in one of tomorrow’s most exciting technologies. The company released its first EV, theTesla Roadster, in 2008. The car’s launch attracted considerable fanfare: its range, acceleration, and top speed were all unprecedented for a mass-produced EV at the time. Fast forward to 2021 and Tesla, now offering four different models and counting, is the world’s biggest-selling EV brand. The company delivered around half a million EVs last year: six times more than in 2016, withrevenuerising more than 300% across that four-year period. Leveraging its expertise in producing the batteries that power its EVs, Tesla today also has a growing energy storage business. These battery systems – essentially shipping containers full of power cells – are increasingly being used to help electricity grids cope with wind and solar power’s naturally fluctuating supply. Tesla’s energy storage deployments were up more than 80% last year, while 2021 should see the company complete construction of the world’slargestbattery facility. Nevertheless, Tesla’s EV arm remains – for now – the firm’s most important driver of revenue andprofit, which is why investors remain obsessed with metrics like quarterly vehicle deliveries. In fact, Tesla’s strategy and its share price – particularly after the latter’s 700% rise in 2020 – are controversial topics in the investor community. On top of CEO (sorry, “Technoking”) Elon Musk’s oftenerraticbehavior, the company’s $1.5 billioninvestmentin bitcoin earlier this year raised a fair few eyebrows. But with astockmarket value more than100 timeshigher than 2021’s projected profit, the most important questions arguably relate to the appropriateness of Tesla’s valuation. The purpose of this Pack is therefore to present you with a professional-style framework you can use to value Tesla’s stock for yourself – allowing you to get properly informed before (or even after) you consider investing. Tesla is currently in the high-growth phase of its development as a company. That means profit and profitability are generally growing, albeit erratically. Tesla’s cash flow is also all over the place as it spends heavily on building new factories and increasing production – and shortfalls often have to be plugged by freshsalesof shares or debt, both of which impact the company’s per-share valuation. Taken together, all this means that it’s hard to value Tesla today by simply applying a multiple to its current earnings, or else trying to forecast its medium-term cash flows and then discounting them to the present. All those variables are arguably just too volatile right now. A better approach may be to ask the following question: what will Tesla’s stabilized earnings look likeafterits growth phase – in, say, 2030? That’s the path we’re going to take in this Pack. Based on various well-educated assumptions, we’ll attempt to forecast Tesla’s financial position in 2030 in terms of both revenue and profit and use this to value Tesla’s future stock. We can then discount this valuation back to the present to see what the company’s shares should be worth today. We can also calculate the average annualized return investors can expect given the difference between Tesla’s actual stock price at present and the theoretical “fair value” per share in 2030. But before we get to that, let’s kick things into gear by investigating what Tesla’s future revenue might look like. Tesla generated $31.5 billion of revenue in 2020. The bulk of that – $25.7 billion, to be precise – came from selling cars and related services such as internet connectivity, over-the-air software updates, and access to the company’s EV charging network. The remainder came from regulatory credit sales, repair and maintenance services, and the company’s energy storage business. We’ll touch on these in a bit – but for now, let’s focus on forecasting the biggest driver of Tesla’s revenue: auto sales. This involves estimating two key figures: thenumber of cars sold(or, given Tesla’s previously notorious production backlog, delivered), and theaverage selling price(ASP)per car. You can see the relevant data for the last five years shown below. Tesla delivered half a million cars in 2020, representing an impressivecompound annual growth rate (CAGR)of 60% since 2016. And the company’s ambition is to maintain a similarly strong average growth rate of 50% over the medium term, according to its latest shareholder deck. Tesla should be able to keep expanding production capacity thanks to a recently opened Shanghai plant as well as forthcoming factories in both Berlin and Texas. In terms of forecasting Tesla’s vehiclesalesin 2030, a top-down approach is probably our best bet: first looking at total projected global EV sales for 2030, and then multiplying that by Tesla’s estimated future market share. Accordingto research providerBloomberg New Energy Finance(BNEF), 1.7 million EVs were sold worldwide in 2020. (Note that this only includes the battery electric vehicles Tesla sells and not plug-in hybrids.) Tesla’s 500,000 vehicle deliveries therefore accounted for around 30% of the global EV market last year. BNEF predicts annual global EV sales will hit 26 million by 2030. But it’s unrealistic to expect Tesla to maintain a 30% market share in the face of rising competition from traditional automakers likeVolkswagen,Hyundai,BMW, and theRenault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance, as well as Chinese upstarts such asNIO,Xpeng, andLi Auto. If we assume that Tesla’s market share accordingly drops to 20%, then that would represent 20% x 26 million = 5.2 million vehicle sales in 2030. Feel free to make your own educated assumptions here, of course – this is all a matter of conjecture. Time for a sense check: 5.2 million Tesla vehicle sales in 2030 would represent a 26% CAGR over the next decade. That matches up pretty well with the company’s ambitions to grow vehicle deliveries at a 50% CAGR over the next few years. You’d then naturally expect that rate to drop off in the second half of this decade: it’s much harder to maintain a high growth rate as the numbers get bigger. By way of comparison, investment bankMorgan StanleyexpectsTesla’s 2030 deliveries to sit at 5.4 million, while investment firmWedbush SecuritiespredictsTesla will approach 5 million annual deliveries by the end of the decade. Some analysts are even more optimistic:ARK Investment Managementexpects Tesla’s vehicle deliveries in2025to hit 5 million at worst, and a whopping 10 million in the best-case scenario. So what about the average selling price for the company’s EVs? This has been decreasing lately due to what’s known as the “mix effect”: as shown below, an increasing proportion of Tesla’s sales are of cheaper vehicles such as theModel 3andModel Y(prices starting at $37,000 and $49,000 respectively). In 2020, the company’s ASP was $51,400. As shown below, however, research from consultancyOliver WymansuggestsEVcostswill fall by around a fifth over the next decade. If we assume that the competitive EV market reflects this in vehicle prices, and that the mix effect at Tesla continues on its present course, then the company’s ASP could well fall 25% to reach $38,500 in 2030. Once again, feel free to use your own assumptions. Intuitively, however, Tesla’s ASP will have to decline in order for it to access greater levels of EV demand. If Tesla is going to sell 5.2 million vehicles annually by 2030, the average car will probably have to have a more affordable price tag attached. 5.2 million vehicles at an ASP of $38,500 would give Tesla $200.3 billion ofautorevenuein 2030. We can safely assume revenue from selling regulatory credits will be zero: these are due to be phased out. The company’s revenue from repair and maintenance services, meanwhile, averaged 10% of auto revenue over the past four years. Keeping that percentage flat, 10% x $200 billion = $20 billion of additional revenue from selling services in 2030. Finally, and significantly, Tesla generated almost $2 billion of revenue from selling battery energy storage systems in 2020. This business is expected to be a big part of Tesla’s future: in fact, CEO Muskthinksit could eventually contribute at least as much revenue as EVsales. As wind and solar power come to represent a greater portion of more countries’ generation capacities, efficient battery storage will become critical to the effective management of electricity grids. The chart below shows consultancyWood Mackenzie’spredictions for global energy storage capacity increases over the next decade: itexpectsa 31% compound annual growth rate. For Tesla, let’s assume that 2020’s $2 billion energy storage revenue will rise at a 20% CAGR to hit $12.3 billion in 2030. This involves partially offsetting Wood Mackenzie’s capacity forecasts against expectations for falling battery storage prices, which will likely reduce Tesla’s revenue per unit of battery storage sold. As ever, you may want to use your own assumptions. Putting all the above together gives us a total Tesla 2030revenueforecast of $232.7 billion, summarized in the table below. Note that the cells in yellow represent where we’ve inserted assumptions that you can play around with further. More specifically, we’re forecastingEBITDA: earnings beforeinterest, taxes, and non-cash expenses such as depreciation andamortization. EBITDA essentially calculates a company’s operatingprofitbefore factoring in the impacts of various financing and accounting decisions. It’s very common to value companies based on some multiple of EBITDA – so this is the metric we’re going to focus on in this Pack. The simplest way to calculate Tesla’s future EBITDA would be to multiply ourrevenueforecast by some assumedmarginpercentage indicating how many cents of EBITDA the firm makes for each dollar ofsales. Tesla’s EBITDA margin in 2020 was 18.4% – but that overstates how much profit the company is generating from its core businesses. That’s because Tesla’s 2020 EBITDA includes $1.6 billion of revenue from selling regulatory credits, a source of cash that will likely soon disappear. Stripping this out gives us a purer EBITDA margin of 13.4% in 2020. That’s still an impressive number. Japanese automakerToyotahas some of the highest profit margins in the old-school industry, and its 2020 EBITDA margin stood at 13.2%. Tesla is fortunate in that it generates some sales from extremely high-margin services such as software upgrades: in the screenshot below, for example, you can see Tesla’s online store offers the option of a $10,000 self-driving top-up at checkout. Play around with your own precognitions here, but we’ll assume Tesla’sEBITDAmarginwill expand by ten percentage points to hit 23.4% in 2030, driven by two main factors. First, Tesla should benefit from an increased manufacturing scale lowering the cost of its EV production. Second, technological developments mean the company may well sell more high-margin software products to its customers. As a sense check, we can draw an analogy withApple, which first sellsiPhonesand then sells software and services to iPhone users. Apple’s EBITDA margin is around 30%. Multiplying our 2030revenueforecast of $232.7 billion by our 23.4% EBITDA margin gives us a 2030 Tesla EBITDA estimate of $54.5 billion. Now we’ve forecasted Tesla’s 2030 EBITDA, we can value the entire company by applying a commonly used valuation multiple calledEV/EBITDA– or enterprise-value-to-EBITDA.Enterprise value(not to be confused with electric vehicles) is the value of a company’s outstanding shares plus its “net debt” – total debt minus cash holdings. Enterprise value is essentially what someone would have to pay to buy the entire company. So what EV/EBITDA multiple should we use when valuing Tesla? A common approach to making that decision involves seeing what multiples similar companies are trading at. Tesla in 2030 will probably be a hybrid between an automaker and a tech company with a powerful premium brand – and as alluded to previously, Tesla’s mixture of hardware and software specialties means it may find a close analogue in tech giant Apple. As the table below shows, the average EV/EBITDA of the world’s 10 largest automakers stood at 11.7x at the time of writing. Apple’s multiple meanwhile stood at 23.5x. Averaging the two gives us 17.6x – and applying that to our 2030 EBITDA estimate of $54.5 billion yields a forecasted 2030 enterprise value for Tesla of $960 billion. Because enterprise value is the value of a company’s outstanding shares plus its net debt, we need to subtract Tesla’s forecasted net debt in 2030 to arrive at a purestockvaluation. As of the time of writing, Tesla’s net debt is actually negative: it’s got more cash on its balance sheet than borrowings. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll assume net debt is zero in 2030 as Tesla spends some of its current cash and/or issues more debt to fund its expansion over the next decade. If Tesla’s forecasted 2030 enterprise value of $960 billion is also its total stock value, then we can divide that by the number of shares outstanding (960 million at the time of writing) to arrive at a nice, round valuation of $1,000 per share in 2030. You can interpret the present-day significance of this in two different ways. One involves discounting the valuation and comparing the result to Tesla’sstockprice today. Discounting $1,000 in nine years’ time at 10% per year, for example, gives you a $424 per share value today – whereas Tesla is actually trading for around $675. Alternatively, you can calculate how much you’d make investing in Tesla shares at today’s prices and watching them rise to that $1,000 level in 2030: a 4.5% compounded annual return. Whether you think these assumptions are fair and accurate – or whether you think Tesla has more upside to gain from, say, launching a fully autonomous taxi network – is outside the scope of this Pack. The main point is that you’ve now got a framework that you can use and play around with to arrive at your very own valuation for Tesla. You can download our model’s Excel fileherein order to explore things further. Adjusting its variables based on different assumptions will help you think more deeply about Tesla’s future – allowing you to weigh in on the company’s great valuation debate and invest (or not, as the case may be) with greater confidence. Arise, Technoking… 🔹 Tesla designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles – but it’s also increasingly getting into battery energy storage systems. 🔹 Since Tesla is currently in a high-growth phase with erratic profitability, valuation attempts should first begin by forecasting its future, stabilized financials. 🔹 To forecast the company's 2030revenue, we're assuming that it makes 20% of the 26 million projected global EVsalesthat year and that their ASP is 25% lower than in 2020. 🔹 We’re assuming Tesla’sEBITDAmarginwill meanwhile expand to 23.4% as it benefits from increased manufacturing scale and more higher-margin software sales. 🔹 Applying a 17.6x EV/EBITDA multiple (arrived at by averaging large automakers' and Apple's current multiples) gives Tesla a valuation of $1,000 per share in 2030.

The Model 3 and Y were again the most popular cars in the Tesla range, with just 21,551 \\'other models (like the Cybertruck) being delivered in the quarter.Elon Musk stated that the nearly 50% drop in profits at the end of the second quarter was \\'temporary\\' and mainly due to difficulties competing with companies like BYD and other \\'cheaper\\' brands, which offer EVs at a lower price point than Tesla.Tesla Q2 Deliveries 2024:443,956Q3:In its Q3 earnings call, Tesla reported that shares increased by 12%.This means that the earnings per share was $0.72 - far higher than investors\\' predictions of $0.60 per share.While revenue was slightly less than expected - $25.18 billion against a Wall Street projection of $25.43 billion - Musk reassured investors that he believed Tesla would be the most profitable company in the world if they can execute their plans.Latest News for TeslaTesla is regularly in the news - and not always for the right reasons. This is the latest Tesla news:In September 2024, Tesla\\'s German plant made headlines after managers were sent to the homes of employees on long-term paid sick leave. The manufacturing director of Tesla’s Berlin-Brandenburg gigafactory defended the decision describing it as a common industry practice.This move has sparked criticism from the trade union IG Metall, which represents some of the 12,000 workers at the plant, accusing Tesla of harsh working conditions contributing to high sick leave rates (sometimes reaching 15%). While Thierig argued some employees were exploiting Germany\\'s labor protection laws, IG Metall maintained that Tesla\\'s approach was worsening stress and sickness among its workforce.The same factory in September 2024 produced its 400,000th vehicle - a feat achieved in just two and a half years of operation. The factory currently only builds the Tesla Model Y.October 10th - Tesla\\'s robotaxi, the \\'Cybercab\\'Tesla revealed its highly anticipated robotaxi, or \"Cybercab\" as Elon Musk has referred to it, at the \"We, Robot\" event in Burbank, California. If launched, the Cybercab will share the roads with driverless robotaxis that are already operating in the US, developed by companies like Waymo (owned by Alphabet, Google\\'s parent company).The reveal was originally planned for August, but was delayed after Musk requested a design change. Revealed at the event, the vehicle features butterfly doors and has 2 seats. The Cybercab prototypes also don\\'t have a steering wheel or pedals, being fully \\'optimised for autonomy\\'.Musk stated that the Cybercab will cost around $30,000.Musk also wants the car to launch before 2027, but it\\'s currently unclear how realistic that timeline is.The car is also planned to charge via wireless induction charging - the prototypes had no physical charging port.There are also no plans for a front trunk, meaning production models will probably just have the rear trunk showcased at the event.It\\'s reported that Tesla aim for the range of the Cybercab to be around 200 miles.Tesla are aiming for the Cybercab to achieve around 5.5 miles per kWh - the most efficient EVs today achieve around 3-4 miles per kWh.November 6th - Tesla shares soar after Trump victoryTesla\\'s stock price has risen 37% since election night (as of Monday 11th November).On Monday 11th, the stock hit its highest price since April 2022 at $345.Since the election, Tesla has added about $300 billion in market value.Musk is now worth around $318 billion, more than $80 billion wealthier than the next richest person.A Tesla Cybertruck was spotted as part of Trump\\'s motorcade in Texas on November 20th.Tesla Company InformationTesla Company ValueWhat is Tesla’s market cap?As of November 7th 2024, Tesla has a market cap of $935.03 Billion.The automaker’s end-of-year market cap for 2023 was$789.89 billion.Tesla’s highest stock closing price was$409.97 on November 04, 2021.Since the 2024 Presidential Election in the US, Tesla has added $350 billion in market capitalisation.In comparison,Toyotaended 2023 with a market cap of$247.48 billionandVolkswagenclosed with a market cap of$64.19 billion.Tesla Market Share – how does Tesla compare to other manufacturers?Tesla sold 654,888 EVs in the US in 2023, making it the undisputed champion of EV sales in the US with a market share of 55%. For comparison, in 2022 Tesla had a 65% market share.BrandUS sales in 2023EV market shareTesla654,88855%Ford-Lincoln72,6086%General Motors75,8486.4%Volkswagen Group70,3985.9%Mercedes-Benz35,2722.9%Elon MuskElon Musk is Tesla\\'s largest shareholder with 715 million shares, the CEO and the public face of the company. He is also the CEO, CTO and Chief Designer at SpaceX, and owner and previous CEO of Twitter (rebranded as X) after a $44 billion takeover of the social media platform.Elon Musk supported Trump during the 2024 US presidential election. The former president\\'s re-election saw Tesla\\'s market value exceed $1 trillion for the first time since 2022, with Musk\\'s personal net worth topping $300 billion.What is Elon Musk\\'s Salary?Elon Musk\\'s salary at Tesla is 0$ - he doesn\\'t take payment in the \\'usual\\' form, and is instead compensated through stock options. Tesla are pushing to pay Musk $56 billion for his work over the last 6 years, as Tesla\\'s market value increased by as much as $650 billion over the last 10 years. However, the deal was blocked by a US judge who found the deal unfair to shareholders.The Calpers (the largest state public pension fund in the US) CEO stated on May 29th that, as of that day, they would vote against Elon Musk\\'s proposed pay package, as they did not believe the compensation reflected the performance of Tesla. They stressed that this position could change based on the outcome of a talk they were yet to have with Musk.The shareholder vote passed in June, by 75%.Elon Musk\\'s Pay AwardA Delaware judge ruled that Tesla couldn\\'t pay Musk its proposed $56 billion pay award, the ruling stating that Tesla had failed to prove the fairness of the package. Conflict of interest laws in Delaware mean that all investors, not just minority investors, need to be protected - the judge ruled that the pay shouldn\\'t be so large.It\\'s possible that issuing a new package with similar terms could trigger a large corporate accounting charge ($50 billion or more) due to Tesla\\'s shares being worth more in 2024 compared to 2018. There would also be a separate tax rate (up to 57%) on Musk\\'s shares.EmployeesHow many employees does Tesla have?In 2023, Tesla had 140,500 employees. This number is likely lower now in 2024 as Musk laid off the entire Supercharger team - 500 employees were fired in the cutbacks.Why did Tesla fire its Supercharger team?While Tesla or Elon Musk haven\\'t released an official statement outlining why the EV manufacturer dismissed its entire Supercharger team (approximately 500 employees), changing priorities may have prompted the sacking.Musk said on X (formerly Twitter) that Tesla is still committed to building chargers, and in 2024 $500 million will be spent on new chargers in the network. However, expansion will be slower, with the primary focus on ensuring 100% uptime and expanding existing locations.HistoryWho is the owner of Tesla?No single entity or individual fully owns Tesla. As of 2023,Elon Muskis the biggest shareholder with715 million shareswhich is20.6% of Tesla stocks.The Vanguard Group holds 225.94 million shares - 7% of Tesla stocks.Blackrock has 186.65 million shares - 5.8% of Tesla stocks.When was Tesla founded?Tesla was founded on 1st July 2003, in San Carlos ( California), United States by two engineers, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.Elon Musk led the initial rounds of investing for Tesla before taking over as CEO in October 2008.As of 2023, Tesla has 140,500 employees.How many Teslas are there in the world?As of 2024, there are around 5 million Teslas worldwide.

If they can’t, the automakers have to buyregulatory creditsfrom another automaker that meets those requirements – such as Tesla, which exclusively sells electric cars.It’s a lucrative business for Tesla – bringing in $3.3 billion over the course of the last five years, nearly half of that in 2020 alone. The $1.6 billion in regulatory credits it received last year far outweighed Tesla’snet income of $721 million– meaning Tesla would have otherwise posted a net loss in 2020.“These guys are losing money selling cars. They’re making money selling credits. And the credits are going away,” said Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research and one of the biggest bears on Tesla(TSLA)shares.Tesla top executives concede the company can’t count on that source of cash continuing.“This is always an area that’s extremely difficult for us to forecast,” said Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn. “In the long term, regulatory credit sales will not be a material part of the business, and we don’t plan the business around that. It’s possible that for a handful of additional quarters, it remains strong. It’s also possible that it’s not.”The 11 states which will require a certain percentage of cars to be zero emission vehicles, or the automakers to purchase credits from a company like Tesla which has exceeded the target, are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont.Tesla also reports other measures of profitability, as do many other companies. And by those measures, the profits are great enough that they do not depend on the sales of credits to be in the black.The company reported 2020 adjusted net income, excluding items such as$1.7 billion stock-based compensation, of $2.5 billion. Its automotive gross profit, which compares total revenue from its car business to expenses directly associated with the building the cars, was $5.4 billion, even excluding the regulatory credits sales revenue. And its free cash flow of $2.8 billion was up 158% from a year earlier, a dramatic turnaround from 2018 when Tesla wasburning through cashand indanger of running out of money.Its supporters say those measures show Tesla is making money at last after years of losses in most of those measures. That profitability is one of the reasons the stock performed so well for more than a year.But the debate between skeptics and devotees of the company whether Tesla is truly profitable has become a “Holy War,” according to Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures and a leading tech analyst.“They’re debating two different things. They’ll never come to a resolution,” he said. Munster believes critics focus too much on how the credits still exceed net income. He contends that automotive gross profit margin, excluding those sales of regulatory credits, is the best barometer for the company’s financial success.“It’s a leading indicator,” of that measure of Tesla’s profit, he said. “There’s no chance that GM and VW are making money on that basis on their EVs.”The future of TeslaTesla’slofty stock performance– up 743% in 2020 – makes it one of themost valuable US companiesin the world. Yet the 500,000 cars it sold in 2020 were a sliver of more than 70 million vehicles estimated to have been sold worldwide.Tesla shares are now worth roughly as much as those of the combined 12 largest automakers who sell more than 90% of autos globally.What Tesla has that other automakers don’t is rapid growth – last week it forecast annual sales growth of 50% in coming years, and it expects to do even better than that in 2021 as other automakers struggle to get back to pre-pandemic sales levels.Tesla Inc. electric vehicles charge at a supercharger station on January 4, 2021 in Redondo Beach, California. - After shares rocketed higher in 2020 on surging auto deliveries, Tesla enters 2021 with plenty of momentum even as its vision of taking electric cars mainstream remains a way off.

Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesRelated articleTesla disappoints Wall Street despite strong profitsThe entire industry is moving toward an all-electric future, both to meet tougher environmental regulations globally and to satisfy the growing appetite for EVs, partly because they require less labor, fewer parts and cost less to build than traditional gasoline-powered cars.“Something most people can agree on is that EVs are the future,” said Munster. “I think that’s a safe assumption.”While Tesla is the leading maker of electric cars, it faces increased competition as virtually every automaker rolls out their own EVs, or plan to do so.Volkswagen has passed Teslain terms of EV sales in most of Europe. GM said last week it hopes to shift completely toemissions-free carsby 2035.“The competition is rendering Tesla’s cars irrelevant,” said GLJ’ Resarch’s Johnson.  “We do not see this as a sustainable business model.”Other analysts contend Tesla’s share price is justified given how it can benefit from the shift to electric vehicles.“They’re not going to stay at 80-90% share of the EV market, but they can keep growing even with much lower market share,” said Daniel Ives, a technology analyst with Wedbush Securities. “We’re looking at north of 3 million to 4 million vehicles annually as we go into 2025-26, with 40% of that growth coming from China. We believe now they are on the trajectory that even without [the EV] credits they’ll still be profitable.”\",\n",
       "   'AFPShockingly low quarterly sales figures fromTeslaInc. this week are raising a fundamental question for investors: If the days of breakneck growth are over, what are the shares ofElon Musk’s company really worth?Budget with ETWhat India Inc needs in Budget to drive growth amid global challengesBudget 2025-26 needs to focus on capex, infrastructure spending: RBI MPC member Nagesh KumarSpace sector seeks PLI scheme, tax holidays, more use of satellite dataThe concerns are valid. The number of cars Tesla sold in the first quarter missed Wall Street’s expectations by such a wide margin that it’s worth wondering how much of the electric vehicle giant’s demand problem is baked into the lofty expectations for itsrevenueand earnings growth over the next few years.“There is not a lot of visibility on where Tesla’s next leg of growth will be — whether EVs or its other projects,” said Nicholas Colas, co-founder ofDataTrekResearch. “If you are going to command a premium multiple you will have to have great earnings visibility or afantastic storyon why those earnings will show up in the future. Tesla has neither at the moment.”The growth issue around Tesla has become so sensitive, that a report on Friday saying the company was getting rid of its low-cost EV plans — which were considered key to fixing its demand problem — sent the stock tumbling more than 6%. Musk rushed to refute the story in a post on his social media site, X, which erased roughly half the decline but still left it as the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 for the session. Then after the market closed, Must posted on X that the company will unveil its “robotaxi” on Aug. 8, causing a rally in after-hours trading.“Tesla needs a $25,000 compact vehicle as a flanker product to compete with the many $25,000 EVs being launched,” said Gary Black, co-founder ofFuture Fund Advisors. “Doubling down on a robotaxi vehicle at this point would be incredibly risky.”Artificial Intelligence(AI)Java Programming with ChatGPT: Learn using Generative AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Basics of Generative AI: Unveiling Tomorrows InnovationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Generative AI for Dynamic Java Web Applications with ChatGPTBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Mastering C++ Fundamentals with Generative AI: A Hands-OnBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramMarketingPerformance Marketing for eCommerce BrandsBy - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara MarketersView ProgramOffice ProductivityZero to Hero in Microsoft Excel: Complete Excel guide 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramFinanceA2Z Of MoneyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView ProgramMarketingModern Marketing Masterclass by Seth GodinBy - Seth Godin, Former dot com Business Executive and Best Selling AuthorView ProgramAstrologyVastu Shastra CourseBy - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu ShashtriView ProgramStrategySuccession Planning MasterclassBy - Nigel Penny, Global Strategy Advisor: NSP Strategy Facilitation Ltd.View ProgramData ScienceSQL for Data Science along with Data Analytics and Data VisualizationBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)AI and Analytics based Business StrategyBy - Tanusree De, Managing Director- Accenture Technology Lead, Trustworthy AI Center of Excellence: ATCIView ProgramWeb DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramMarketingDigital Marketing Masterclass by Pam MooreBy - Pam Moore, Digital Transformation and Social Media ExpertView ProgramArtificial Intelligence(AI)AI-Powered Python Mastery with Tabnine: Boost Your Coding SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramOffice ProductivityMastering Microsoft Office: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 365By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramMarketingDigital marketing - Wordpress Website DevelopmentBy - Shraddha Somani, Digital Marketing Trainer, Consultant, Strategiest and Subject Matter expertView ProgramOffice ProductivityMastering Google Sheets: Unleash the Power of Excel and Advance AnalysisBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramWeb DevelopmentMastering Full Stack Development: From Frontend to Backend ExcellenceBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramFinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView ProgramData ScienceSQL Server Bootcamp 2024: Transform from Beginner to ProBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView ProgramAll of which helps explain why Tesla’s stock has struggled so much this year. Its 34% plunge makes it by far the biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100 Index since the start of January, and the worst performer on the S&P 500 Index. About 76% of the company’s current valuation is still predicated on its future earnings potential, according to a DataTrek analysis.Sales Shock“We cautionTesla sharescould fall much further still should the company not be successful in quickly restoring unit volume and revenue growth,” JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday, pointing out the risk to Tesla’s stockmarket capitalizationif it’s no longer perceived as a hyper-growth company.Tesla sold about 387,000 cars in the first quarter, while analysts on average thought that number would be around 449,000. Obviously, profit estimates for the quarter will now have to be cut, after already dropping by more than half in a year. It also puts the company on track for a second straight year of declining annual earnings. In fact, analysts on average now expect that it will take until 2026 for Tesla to exceed the level of profitability it posted in 2022.That, however, does not mean the shares are cheap. At 59 times forward earnings, Tesla’s the most expensive member of the Magnificent 7 group of big tech companies. High-flier Nvidia Corp. trades at a multiple of around 36, and Amazon.com Inc. is at 45. Yet, Tesla has the lowest growth estimates of the three for this year. And its stock is the biggest decliner in the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Price Return Index in 2024.Brinkman believes there’s a decent chance that Tesla’s revenue drops materially in the first quarter, “likely causing even the most bullish investors to take a sentiment check.” Analysts on average expect a slight decline of around 0.6%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Despite Wall Street’s seeming surprise over Tesla’s troubles, no one should complain they weren’t warned. Tesla first noted the weakening pace of demand in October last year. But the reaction shows how few people fully grasped the speed of the deceleration.“Analysts knew that EV growth was waning, but the extent at which it would impact sales was misunderstood on Wall Street last quarter,” Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO of 50 Park Investments, said in an interview.Potential ReboundWith all of this being said, Tesla shares could rebound in the short term as dip buyers start sniffing around. They closed at $164.90 on Friday after trading as low as $160.51 when the news of the low-cost vehicles first hit. Chart technicians, who analyze stock moves to spot such reversals in trends, say the shares appear to be finding a near-term bottom. In other words, the most intense part of the selloff may be done — at least for now.“As long as the stock stays above $150-$160 area, technically, it is trying to trace out a bottom,” 50 Park’s Sarhan said.But the company will have to show more for the stock price to have a sustained recovery. Investors need to be convinced that Tesla can return to its strong growth, fat margins and highly innovative ways. Right now the story is shrinking demand and a shaky outlook, which cuts to the heart of the company’s towering stock market valuation.“It is challenging to call a bottom at this stage because there is not a true catalyst on the horizon,” said David Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments. Stemming the bleed in the shares will require Tesla to pull a “proverbial rabbit out the hat,” he said.“It looks like Musk is trying to do just that with his latest X post on the robotaxi,” Mazza said. “But unless the company shares specific news on shoring up the core EV franchise, the impact may be illusionary.”(You can now subscribe to ourEconomic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onteslaElon MuskRevenueMarket Capitalizationfuture fund advisorsdatatrekfantastic storyTesla shares(Catch all theBusiness News,Breaking News,Budget 2024Events andLatest NewsUpdates onThe Economic Times.)Subscribe toThe Economic Times Primeand read theET ePaperonline....moreless(You can now subscribe to ourEconomic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News onteslaElon MuskRevenueMarket Capitalizationfuture fund advisorsdatatrekfantastic storyTesla shares(Catch all theBusiness News,Breaking News,Budget 2024Events andLatest NewsUpdates onThe Economic Times.)Subscribe toThe Economic Times Primeand read theET ePaperonline....morelessPrime ExclusivesInvestment IdeasStock Report PlusePaperWealth EditionHonda’s electric scooter pricing sharpens industry debate on its strategyThere has been a massive rebound in air travel in the last three months: Akasa CEO Vinay DubeA falling rupee has a doomy message for everyone but these stocksBhavish Aggarwal kicks off Ola group restructuring.

       "   \"Vehicles at a Tesla store in Colma, California, US.David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FileNew YorkCNN—Tesla reported record quarterly sales in the final three months of last year, but it wasn’t enough for it to hang onto its title as the world’s largest maker of electric vehicles.The companyreported global sales of 484,507 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a bit better than expected and up nearly 20% from what it sold in the same period of 2022. It was less than the 526,409 EVssold by Chinese automaker BYD, but Tesla stayed ahead of BYD in total full-year sales. BYD vehicles are sold in Asia and Europe but are not yet available in North America.Tesla is facing greater competition from not just BYD, but from established global automakers that are increasing their EV offerings and capacity.Telsa’s near 20% growth is down from the higher growth rate earlier this year that gave it a 38% gain for the year. And that annual growth rate is well below the 50% annual growth target set by Tesla.A view shows model BYD ATTO 3 of BYD, a Chinese automobile manufacturer, displayed during an event a day ahead of the official opening of the 2023 Munich Auto Show IAA Mobility, in Munich, Germany, September 4, 2023. REUTERS/Leonhard SimonLeonhard Simon/ReutersChina’s BYD is selling more electric cars than TeslaBut the pace of growth in demand for EVs from consumers appears to be slowing for all brands, not just Tesla. Some of the legacy automakers, such as Ford and General Motors, havepulled backEV production in the near term, even though they’ve announced plans to shift from traditional gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs in the years ahead.The EV market has seen pockets of strength, most notably in Norway, where the Norwegian Road Federation reported Tuesday that 82% of nationwide sales in 2023 were electric vehicles, up from 79% in 2022. Traditional gasoline powered cars made up less than 4% of sales in Norway last year.But the group said economic uncertainty and tight finances reduced overall vehicle sales there by 8%, with the number of EVs sold falling nearly 5%, despite the gain in market share.Tesla was once again the best selling automaker in Norway last year with a 20% share of the market, up from a 12% share of the market in 2022. The gains came despite a dispute betweenTesla and unions in Norway, Swedenand other Nordic countries, which has snarled deliveries of Teslas to Sweden and could cause additional problems going forward for the nonunion automaker.Emma Hansson, chairman of IF Metall Stockholm Country, stands on strike outside Tesla's service center in Stockholm, Sweden, on October 27.Jessica Gow/TT News Agency/ReutersNordic workers took on Elon Musk in 2023. Here’s what could happen nextTesla has responded to the growing competition and higher interest rates that have driven up the cost of ownership bycutting pricesof its vehicles, a move that has kept sales increasing but hassqueezed its profit margins.Tesla also faces a headwind in that some of its vehicles, including some of its Model 3’s, havelost the full $7,500 federal tax creditas of Monday that had been available to many US buyers. There are limits to the tax credit for EVs using Chinese batteries or materials, even if the cars are assembled in a US factory. There are also limits on the tax credits for high-income buyers.Tesla also faced some difficult headlines in recent months, including arecallordered on 2 million cars, virtually all of the vehicles it had produced for the US, due to a federal regulator’s findings that its Autodrive feature posed a safety threat because it could be used away from the highways on which it is designed to be engaged.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also generated controversy this year for his comments and tweets, such oneretweetclaiming that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.” But while those controversies caused advertisers to flee X, the social media platform he owns formerly known at Twitter, it’s not clear that what impact, if any, it has had on Tesla sales.The sales growth at Tesla is a good sign for the company according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities who is a bull on Tesla shares.“This was a clear win for [Tesla CEO Elon] Musk and Tesla as hitting 1.8 million vehicles for 2023 was a major achievement in a choppy macro for EVs,” he wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.Tesla did not break out the sales of its Cybertruck, lumping it in with the luxury Model S and Model X as “other models” in the sales report. Itstarted deliveriesof the long-delayed pickup on November 30, but Musk has warned investors it will take more than a year to ramp up production of the truck.The company is late to the game in bringing an electric pickup to market, trailing offerings from Ford, GM and upstart Rivian. While Ford and GM have yet to report fourth quarter sales, Rivian reported it delivered just under 14,000 trucks in the quarter, up 73% from a year ago, and about 50,000 for the year, up 147%.Shares ofTeslawere little changed in morning trading on the slightly better-than-expected sales news Tuesday. Tesla shares doubled in 2023, recapturing just over half the losses they suffered in 2022. But they’re down 15% from their 52-week high reached in July, and they lost 5% in just the closing days of December trading.\"],\n",

[+]phone screen with AI (artificial intelligence) written in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesUpdated, July 10, 2024: This post has been adjusted to clarify some points about Amazon Web Services and include comments from the company.Amazon has pioneered enormously important new industries.However, that happened before founder and CEO Jeff Bezos handed over the CEO job in July 2021. Amazon’s contributions include online selling of everything from books to video streaming services, and transforming its computer systems into a new industry — cloud services.Despite continuing to lead the industry, Amazon Web Services’ revenue growth rate lags Microsoft’s Azure’s. The difference between the two has been Microsoft’s generative AI strategy — featuring a $13 billion bet on OpenAI — creator of ChatGPT.Amazon does not agree. “We see more absolute dollar growth in AWS quarter over quarter than we can see elsewhere,” according to a July 8 email from an Amazon spokesperson.By 2026, Azure could overtake AWS, noted a FebruaryForbespost. I reach that same conclusion using the two businesses’ first quarter 2024 revenue growth rate results — the most recently available data.Since then, in April, Amazon announced a generative AI strategy,Yahoo! Financereported. In June the company shared a plan to invest more than $100 billion in data centers by 2034, according to theWall Street Journal.MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributorCan CEO Andy Jassy turn generative AI into a third groundbreaking Amazon innovation? If so, can the e-tailing giant restore the 27.4% average annual revenue growth achieved between 2010 and 2020?Here are three reasons that ambition could be out of reach:Outside of AI chips, the near-term revenue opportunity for generative AI is small. To be sure, predictions of generative AI’s revenue potential are in the trillions of dollars. For example,Bloombergestimates the market for generative AI will grow at a 43% annual rate to $1.3 trillion market by 2032 — as the technology “boosts sales for the tech industry’s hardware, software, services, ads and gaming segments.” In my view, achieving such massive revenue levels hinges on whether AI chatbots create enough value to companies and consumers to justify the investment, as I detailed inBrain Rush.Amazon is playing catch-up against a formidable rival in generative AI cloud services and software. Amazon disagrees, “AWS is now a $100 billion revenue run rate business and AI is a multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate for us,” noted Amazon’s July 6 e-mail.Unless the company’s generative AI strategy wins Amazon a significant share of a large, fast-growing market, any meaningful and faster growth from its generative AI strategies could be elusive.“We do not provide guidance on our annual growth rate,” an Amazon spokesperson emailed me July 1.Amazon’s Generative AI StrategyStrategy defines an internally consistent set of choices about how an organization intends to achieve its goals. A generative AI strategy would set specific revenue goals over time and make clear choices along dimensions needed to achieve the goals, such as:Target customers.Which customer groups in which geographies will the company serve?Products.Which products or services will the company provide to these customer groups?Approach to product development.Will the company develop these products internally, through partnership, or by acquisition?Pricing.Will the company offer a good product at the lowest price or the best product at a high price?Critical activities.How will the company design, build, deliver, market, sell, and service its products?Amazon’s generative AI strategy is vague on some of these dimensions and clearer on others. Amazon’s generative AI strategy consists of three layers:Bottom: developers.Here, Amazon’s custom AI training and inference hips help developers train models and produce predictions, Jassy wrote in an April shareholder letter, according toYahoo! Finance.Middle: companies.Amazon enables companies to use their own data to customize models and build secure generative AI applications, Jassy noted. “More than 10,000 organizations worldwide” use Amazon Bedrock to build generative AI applications including “adidas, ADP, BMW Group, Delta Air Lines, DoorDash, Merck,” and others, according to an Amazon spokesperson’s July 10 email.Top: consumers.In its top layer, Amazon builds generative AI applications for its own consumer businesses, he added.Here is how these layers fit within the dimensions of strategy described above:Generative AI revenue goals.While Amazon has articulated a broad vision, the company has not articulated specific generative AI revenue targets. “The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all,” Jassy wrote. “We’re optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.” For context, Microsoft has shared with investors how much of its Azure growth comes from generative AI, according to theNew York Times.Target customers.Amazon aims to satisfy the needs of developers, “enterprise customers’ and consumers’ generative AI needs,” Jassy noted, according toYahoo! Finance. AWS also helps small companies. “More than 80% of the startups on the 2023 Forbes Next Billion-Dollar Startups list use AWS,” according to Amazon’s July 6 e-mail.Products.Amazon has“all of the pieces in place to be the go-to tech firm for both” customer groups, noted Jassy in the shareholder letter. Amazon strives to meet customer needs by being the everything store for generative AI hardware and software, I noted in my bookBrain Rush. Amazon’s offerings include Graviton CPUs, Trainium large language model training chips, Inferentia LLM inferencing chips, the Rufus chatbot for Amazon’s Marketplace and Amazon Q, “which writes and debugs code for AWS users,” notedYahoo! Finance. Excluded from Amazon’s generative AI products is a “next-gen” Alexa demonstrated to the press in September 2023. “The new Alexa is reportedly far from ready for prime time — the result of insufficient training data, inadequate access to training hardware and other roadblocks,” notedTechCrunch.Approach to product delivery.“Customers don’t want only one model,” Jassy wrote in his letter. “They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of applications.” To that end, Amazon delivers its generative AI products through partnerships and internal development. For example, Amazon offers LLMs through partnerships with Anthropic — in which the company invested $4 billion, Stability AI, Mistral, Meta, Cohere, and Amazon’s own models, noted Jassy. Amazon plans to invest $230 million in free cloud credits to startups building generative AI apps, according toTechCrunch.Pricing.I have not found any information about whether Amazon would seek to offer good products at the lowest price or the best products at a price premium.Critical activities.AWS’ data centers will be the essential delivery mechanism for Amazon’s generative AI strategy. Amazon’s investment of more than $100 billion in cloud computing and AI infrastructure over the next decade will exceed “its sprawling network of e-commerce warehouses,” theJournalreported.To be sure, Amazon could be much clearer in its internal communications than on its public ones. For investors, the most important area of vagueness is how much revenue Amazon expects to earn from generative AI.Due to the intensive computing resources required to train and operate LLMs, “Amazon expects tens of billions of dollars in revenue from AI in the next several years,” theJournalnoted.To put that into perspective, AWS generated $90 billion in revenue — roughly 16% of Amazon’s total 2023 revenue of $575 billion. With Amazon’s total revenue having grown 12% in 2023, $10 billion more in AWS revenue would have added a mere two percentage points to the company’s growth rate in 2023.AWS’ Rivalry With Microsoft AzureAWS maintains a lead in the cloud services market — yet the available numbers suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is growing more rapidly and slowly closing in on AWS’s lead.Back in February, I estimated the two companies’ revenue growth by extrapolating their fourth quarter 2023 revenue and growth rates into the future. In so doing, I estimated Azure’s revenues could exceed AWS’ by 2026.Incorporating the companies’ first quarter 2024 revenue growth rates into my model, yields the same conclusion.To be sure, the the two businesses are far from identical. Azure is part of Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment.Intelligent Cloud offers cloud infrastructure services, application software, and other services. These include basic computing and storage, databases andmonitoring tools, commercial Office subscriptions, the commercial part of LinkedIn and Dynamics 365 enterprise software, according toCNBC.AWS primarily consists of computing tools. Its products include “compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications,” according toAWS.Microsoft does not break out Azure revenue in its financial reports. However, analysts estimated that in 2019 Azure was half the size of AWS. “Now, it’s about three-quarters the size of its top rival,”CNBCreported, citing two analysts—Jamin Ball of Altimeter Capital and Yun Kim of Loop Capital.If Fourth Quarter 2023 Growth Rates Continue, Azure Could Surpass AWS By 2026In the fourth quarter of 2023, Microsoft Azure revenue was growing faster than AWS — raising the prospect of Azure surpassing AWS as the cloud services industry leader by 2026, according to my February 2024Forbespost.AWS is growing far more slowly than Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure unit. In the fourth quarter of 2023, AWS lost two percentage points of market share to 31% while Azure added two percentage points to 24%, according toCRN.In the final quarter of 2023, AWS grew 13% while Azure revenue increased by 30%, notedCNBC.If those trends continue, Azure was in a position to surpass AWS by 2026.Specifically, in 2026 my model estimates Azure revenue will reach $149.6 billion — surpassing AWS’ by $18.6 billion.If First Quarter 2024 Growth Rates Continue, Azure Could Also Surpass AWS By 2026To be sure, AWS grew faster in the first quarter of 2024 — narrowing its growth rate disadvantage by three percentage points. However, Azure’s growth rate ticked up in the quarter. Specifically, AWS’ revenue grew 17% in Q1, according toCNBC, compared to Azure’s 31% growth in the quarter,CRNnoted.In the first quarter of 2024, AWS maintained its 31% share of the cloud services market while Microsoft’s Azure gained one percentage point to 25% of the market, according toStatista.If I assume these first quarter 2024 relative growth rates continue, I reach the same conclusion as before. By 2026, Azure revenue will exceed AWS revenue. Specifically, my model estimates Azure revenue in 2026 will reach $153.1 billion — surpassing AWS’ by $7.7 billion.Will Amazon’s Generative AI Strategy Restore 27.7% Revenue Growth?Amazon’s stock outperformed Microsoft’s shares in the first half of 2024. Specifically, Amazon shares rose 30%, yielding a $2.07 trillion market capitalization. By contrast, Microsoft’s stock rose 22% to a market capitalization of $3.4 trillion during the period, according toGoogle Finance.Microsoft’s stock performance lagged despite growing faster and more profitably than Amazon in the first quarter. The software’s giant’s revenue increased 17% with a net margin of 35.5%. Amazon’s revenue rose 12.5% in the first quarter with a relatively slim net margin of 7.3%,Google Financenoted.Will Generative AI help Amazon grow faster? Jassy told analysts in late April that AWS had already reached a “multibillion-dollar” revenue run rate related to artificial intelligence, notedInvestor’s Business Daily.Amazon — which put former sales and marketing leader Matt Garman in charge of AWS on June 3 — has the right products but has been weaker at marketing. “I think the focus for Jassy over the next year will be to catch up to Microsoft in the generative AI race, at least based on investor perception,” CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram toldIBD.“That's how I see the stock building on its gains,” he added.Amazon stock could have more upside than Microsoft’s. Based on 42 analysts offering 12-month price targets, Amazon stock could rise 13.7% to hit the $221.70 average, notedTipRanks. The 35 analysts offering 12-month price targets for Microsoft see 11% upside to the $500.71 average target,TipRankswrote.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsiteor\\xa0some of my other workhere.Peter CohanFollowingEditorial StandardsForbes AccoladesJoin The ConversationCommentsOne Community.

       "   \"On July 1st, reports emerged that Amazon plans to invest over $100 billion in the next ten years to build data centers, enhancing its AI infrastructure and solidifying its leadership in this field. According to market research firm Dell'Oro Group, last year, Amazon's data center capital expenditure, including rental costs, accounted for 53% of its total capital expenditures, marking a decade-high. Currently, Amazon's investment in cloud computing and AI infrastructure surpasses its investment in retail warehousing. Amazon has proposed data center construction plans for locations such as New Zealand, India, Singapore, and Japan, with investment amounts ranging from $2.8 billion to $9 billion. By heavily investing in AI infrastructure, Amazon aims to become the preferred platform for AI development. Amazon's powerful data centers will meet the substantial computational needs required for processing complex algorithms, attracting more businesses and developers eager to leverage AI technology for their innovation. Moreover, Amazon's AI initiatives are poised to yield significant economic returns. Analysts predict that the project could generate hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue over the next few years. This revenue will come from various business streams, such as licensing AI services to other companies or developing AI products and solutions for consumers. Amazon's strategic move into the AI sector comes at a time when the global AI market is flourishing. According to Statista, the global AI market is expected to reach $184 billion by the end of 2024 and exceed $826 billion by 2030. By adopting a proactive approach, Amazon is strategically positioning itself to capitalize on lucrative market opportunities.

       "   \"< BlogsHome>Featured Blogs>\\n        Amazon Vs. Walmart: Revenue And Profit Comparison, 2010–2024Walmart is the largest US retailer overall, while Amazon dominates online retail. Over the past several years, Amazon’s revenue growth has significantly outpaced Walmart’s, and its profits have also surged. To understand the factors behind these trends, we analyzed their revenues and profits across business segments, geographic regions, and product/service categories.NOTE:For our analysis, we examined the most recent annual financials of both companies. Amazon’s fiscal year (FY) ends in December, meaning its 2023 revenues represent the 12 months ending on December 31, 2023. Walmart’s fiscal year ends in January, so its FY24 revenues correspond to the 12 months ending on January 31, 2024. Since 11 of those 12 months fall within 2023, we compared Walmart’s FY24 revenues with Amazon’s 2023 revenues.Following are three select insights from our analysis:Amazon’s growth far outpaces Walmart and the retail sector.Amazon annual revenues reached $575 billion in 2023, and Walmart total revenues reached $648 billion. Over the last five years (2018–2023), Amazon achieved a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20%, significantly outpacing both Walmart’s 5% growth and the 7% growth in total US retail sales (excluding auto and gas). Extending the analysis to a 13-year period (2010–2023), Amazon’s CAGR stood at an impressive 24%, compared to 3% for Walmart and 5% for the broader US retail industry.In Q4 2024, Amazon’s quarterly revenues could surpass Walmart’s for the first time.For context, in Q1 2010, Amazon’s quarterly revenues were a modest $7 billion compared to Walmart’s $100 billion. Over the next decade, however, Amazon experienced rapid growth, fueled by its expansion into new markets and services. In Q4 2024, consensus estimates project Amazon’s quarterly revenues to reach $186 billion, narrowly surpassing Walmart’s expected $180 billion (see figure below).Amazon widens the net income gap with Walmart.Amazon continues to outpace Walmart in net income. The consensus estimates project Amazon’s net income rising to $51 billion in 2024, up from $30 billion in 2023, with its net profit margin increasing to 8% from 5% (see figure below).In comparison, Walmart’s net income will grow steadily, reaching $20 billion in FY25 with a 3% margin, up from $16 billion (2% margin) in FY24.Wall Street analysts expect the net income gap between the two companies to keep widening, driven by Amazon’s profitability gains in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and its retail media operations. The consensus estimates project Amazon’s net income to increase to $63 billion in 2025 and $79 billion in 2026, compared to Walmart’s projected net income of $22 billion in 2025 and $24 billion in 2026.Walmart’s retail is profitable, but AWS greatly boosts Amazon’s overall profits.Amazon reports revenues and operating profits for three business segments: North America, international, and AWS. In 2023, Amazon’s North America segment generated $353 billion (61% of total revenue). The international segment contributed $131 billion (23%) and AWS added $91 billion (16%). Amazon reported AWS as a business segment for the first time in 2015, when it generated $8 billion in revenue for the company.As for operating profits and margins: In 2023, Amazon’s North America segment generated $15 billion in profit (4% margin). Its international segment incurred a $3 billion loss (-2% margin), while AWS generated $25 billion in profit (27% margin) (see figure below).Walmart’s three business segments are: Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and Sam’s Club. In FY24, Walmart U.S. brought in $442 billion (68% of total revenue), followed by Walmart International at $115 billion (18%) and Sam’s Club at $86 billion (13%).Walmart’s operating profit and margins are more consistent: Walmart U.S. generated $22 billion in operating profit (5% margin), Walmart International $5 billion (4% margin), and Sam’s Club $2 billion (3% margin).Forrester expects a continued shift in retail market share toward Amazon and Walmart over the next five years as both companies invest inartificial intelligenceand machine learning,automationandcustomer experience, and growing alternative sources of revenues and profits such asretail media. As the two companies compete fiercely for higher sales growth, smaller competitors will struggle to keep up due to the strong balance sheets, pricing power, and technology capabilities of these giants. Smaller retailers will need to achieve significant differentiation in terms of service, assortment, and store/online experience.Per Forrester’sUS Online Retail Forecast, 2024 To 2029, the combined US retail sales of Amazon and Walmart will reach $1.5 trillion by 2029, capturing one-fourth of the total US retail market. By 2029, the combined US e-commerce sales of the two companies will reach $1.1 trillion, accounting for two-thirds of total US online retail sales.If you are a Forrester client and would like to learn more,please schedulean inquiry or guidance session with me!CategoriesAge of the CustomerconsumerData AnalysisData Insightsdigital businessRetail TrendsGet The Insights At Work NewsletterBusiness Email Address*Country*CountryUnited StatesÅland IslandsAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBolivia, Plurinational State ofBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos (Keeling) IslandsColombiaComorosCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuyanaHaitiHeard Island and McDonald IslandsHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKorea, Republic ofKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLesothoLiberiaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacaoMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesia, Federated States ofMoldova, Republic ofMonacoMongoliaMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestinian Territory, OccupiedPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunionRomaniaRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da CunhaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint Maarten (Dutch part)SlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSouth AfricaSouth Georgia and the South Sandwich IslandsSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan MayenSwazilandSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzania, United Republic ofThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUnited States Minor Outlying IslandsUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVatican CityVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaZambiaYes, I’d like to receive Forrester’s Insights At Work newsletter and receive occasional survey invitations and marketing communications.Thanks for signing up.Stay tuned for updates from the Forrester blogs.Overhaul Core Competencies With Your 2025 CX BudgetDownload our 2025 Planning Guide for CX leaders to learn how to allocate your 2025 budget to reverse CX declines and boost quality.Get The GuideBlogDry January Is Really A Lesson In Self-OptimizationAudrey Chee-Read4 days agoThe US Surgeon General’s recent warning on alcohol consumption and cancer risk comes at a time when many consumers are participating in dry January, with new terms such as sober-curious being used and demand for “sober bars.” But rather than getting caught up in the pessimistic future of alcoholic beverage companies or the food and […]Read MoreBlog2025: The Digital Banking Landscape Is Poised For Another Transformative YearAurelie L'Hostis6 days agoLeading banks are leveraging mature and emerging technologies, customer insights, and data to enhance customer experience, increase customer engagement, and drive business growth.Read More\",\n",
       "   \"Amazon's revenue grew nearly 44 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, topping $100bn for the first time [File: Bloomberg]ByRyan VlastelicaBloombergPublished On 3 Feb 20213 Feb 2021Amazon.com Inc. breached the $1 billion-a-day revenue mark in 2020, in another example of how the company’s massive growth and market dominance has made its stock a near-unanimous favorite on Wall Street.The e-commerce giant’s fourth-quarter results brought full-year revenue to $386 billion. According to an analysis of\\xa0Bloomberg data, Walmart Inc. is the only other U.S. company with a $1 billion daily sales average, though Exxon Mobil has hit it in the past.Amazon’s massive haul reflects both the holiday shopping season and the pandemic, which accelerated a longstanding shift to online retail over last year. As a measure of how the company is thriving in this environment, revenue grew nearly 44% in the fourth quarter, topping $100 billion for the first time; it also guided toward another quarter above that level.The stock dipped 0.3% to trade around $3,370 on Wednesday, with the results offset by the news that Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos will be stepping down from his post later this year. Amazon’s shares have gained nearly 70% over the past 12 months.AdvertisementWhile Walmart has consistently reported revenue above the $100 billion threshold for years, it is only expected to report revenue growth of about 4.5% when it reports later this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The growth Amazon is seeing is just amazing, and it reflects a structural shift toward e-commerce that isn’t stopping or slowing,” said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital\\xa0Advisors, which owns the stock. In a phone interview, he added that “as this tailwind continues, Amazon will become even more of a behemoth than it already is, and not just in e-commerce, but retail overall.”Among S&P 500 companies with at least $50 billion in annual revenue, only T-Mobile USA Inc. and Centene Corp. had growth above 40% in their most recent quarters, and both were boosted by recent acquisitions. In addition, Amazon is one of only six S&P 500 companies to report at least six consecutive quarters with revenue growth above 20%, along with Netflix Inc., Etsy Inc., Salesforce.com Inc., ServiceNow Inc. and DexCom Inc.Last year, Citi estimated that Amazon will comprise 43% of the domestic e-commerce market by 2022, compared with 38% in 2019, as well as nearly 7% of total U.S. retail sales by 2022, up from 4% in 2019.This kind of potential has made Amazon the best-loved megacap on Wall Street. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, 54 firms recommend buying the stock, compared with only one with a neutral rating. None have a bearish view, resulting in a consensus rating — a proxy for its ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings — of 4.93 out of five, the highest among the largest U.S. companies. The average analyst price target implies additional upside of about 20%, above the return potential of names like Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp.AdvertisementThe company shows “no signs of slowing down after a huge holiday season,” and its leadership in key markets “should emerge even stronger coming out of the pandemic,” wrote Shyam Patil, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group. He sees the stock climbing to $5,200, the highest price target on the Street.Source:Bloomberg\",\n",

The company is on the verge of joining the $2 Trillion Club, driven by a 4-percentage point accelerating in AWS to 17% YoY growth combined with strong 25% growth in advertising revenue. AWS surpassed a $100 billion annualized run rate in the first quarter, with managementnotingthat they “see more absolute dollar growth again quarter-over-quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere.”E-commerce is what Amazon is famous for, however, it’s AWS and advertising that are the core growth engines. This past quarter, the two combined for $37 billion in high-margin revenue. Analyst estimates point toward AWS and advertising exiting 2024 at a combined $160 billion revenue run rate. If this materializes, these segments will combine for one-quarter of Amazon’s total revenue while helping to drive 221% YoY growth in operating income.UKRAINE - 2022/01/08: In this photo illustration, Amazon Web Services logo seen displayed on a... [+]smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesThe synergies from strong double-digit advertising growth, an AI-driven acceleration in AWS, and an increasing cash flow margin support Amazon’s push to all-time highs. Plus, there are hints that the acceleration could continue as more GPU supply comes online, and as Amazon Prime implements ads in Prime Video.Q1 RecapRevenue of $143.3 billion beat estimates by $0.8 billion, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth as Amazon’s revenue growth rate accelerated 310 bp YoY to 12.5%. EPS increased 216% YoY to $0.98, as Amazon continued to realize gains from improved operating leverage, withgross profit rising more than 53% YoY and operating income surging 221% YoY to $15.3 billion.Amazon’s North America segment and AWS both contributed to this operating income growth. North America operating income increased more 500% to $5.0 billion, from $0.9 billion last year; AWS generated $9.4 billion in operating income, up 84% YoY (and a 37.6% margin). Put another way,AWS contributed more than 61% of Amazon’s total operating income in the quarter despite contributing less than 18% of Amazon’s revenue.MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributorNot only is Amazon showing an ability to expand its gross margin from less than 15% towards 20% in 4 quarters, but it’s also driving more pronounced growth in operating margin, reaching double-digits for the first time.Pictured Above: Amazon reaches double digit operating margin for the first time.I/O FundThe tangible improvements to the bottom line are evident as the growth story unfolds. High-margin AWS and advertising revenues are also Amazon’s two fastest growing segments.AWS Seeing AI-Powered GrowthAWS re-accelerated 4 percentage points to 17% YoY growth in the quarter, as CEO Andy Jassyattributedit partly due to the “combination of companies renewing their infrastructure modernization efforts and the appeal of AWS’s AI capabilities.”Growth has cooled rather dramatically since early 2022, where AWS was reporting growth rates above 30%, but at a $100B+ scale, AWS is driving the largest absolute dollar growth across the entirety of Amazon’s businesses.Amazon is not providing a distinct breakout of AI’s contribution like Microsoft Azure, yet CEO Jassy commented that AWS is seeing “considerable momentum on the AI front, where we\\'ve accumulated a multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate already.”AWS re-accelerated 4 percentage points to 17% YoY growth in the quarter, while operating income grew... [+]84% YoY.I/O FundIn Q1, we saw evidence that AWS is benefiting from strong demand for generative AI offerings with management optimistic that increased capex will continue to bear fruit in terms of growth. Interestingly, operating expenses for AWS declined YoY, from $16.2 billion to $15.6 billion, aiding this growth in operating income.In addition, rival Microsoft explicitly pointed out that Azure does not have the GPU capacity to meet demand, Amazon also implied that demand is possibly higher than capacity of both third-party GPUs from Nvidia as well as for its custom silicon. Management noted that in the quarter, they “continued to meet growing demand for AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips,” and explained that a “meaningful” YoY increase in capex in 2024 is being driven by high generative AI demand.One comment in particular hints at possible capacity constraints: “given the way the AWS business model works, [the capex increase] is a positive sign of the future growth. The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers, power, and hardware.”Reading between the lines here implies that Amazon is working to improve availability of its in-house Trainium and Inferentia chips while also expanding its data center infrastructure and purchasing more GPUs to continue to meet high demand gen AI demand. The end result is that AWS will likely accelerate again in future quarters as supply comes online.A Note on CapexAmazon did not provide a full-year figure for capex, but management is anticipating a meaningful YoY increase this year, primarily to support AWS’ growth. Q1’s capex was $14 billion, which management expects will also “be the low quarter for the year.” This suggests 2024’s capex could easily top $60 billion, exiting the year in the mid-$60 billion range or higher, representing a YoY increase of at least 24%.We’re closely tracking Big Tech’s capex plans for 2024 and how this will flow downstream to AI hardware companies. We shared more than half a dozen reports and pre- and post-earnings updates on a handful of AI beneficiaries with our premium members.

Amazon recorded its first $10B ad revenue quarter in Q4 2022, and now has reported four quarters in a row above $10B.On a TTM basis, advertising revenue was just shy of $50 billion, a 51% increase from $32 billion just two years ago. At this rate, Amazon is set to exit 2024 with ad revenues approaching $58 billion annually. Though Amazon does not break out advertising’s operating income like it does other segments, it says it “remains an important contributor to profitability in North America and International segments.” This is primarily made from sponsored ads on Amazon’s e-commerce site and the recent addition of sponsored TV ads, including on Thursday Night Football.It’s also worth noting that ad-tech typically has some of the best margins in the tech industry, exceeding cloud or e-commerce.Advertising is Amazon’s fastest growing segment with 24% YoY growth to $11.8 billion in revenue in... [+]Q1 and it\\'s rapidly scaling.I/O FundAnalysts are already quite optimistic about the revenue trajectory and potential for Prime Video ads which launched in January of this year. For reference, Netflix reported23 million monthly activeusers (MAUs) globally a little over one year after it launched. Amazon is taking a different approach to SVOD ads than Netflix, Disney and others – instead of offering a cheaper, ad-supported tier, Amazon is adding ads to all Prime Video members, and offering an ad-free plan for an additional $3/mo.By putting ads directly in front of an estimated 150+ million viewers, Amazon can benefit both from ad revenue and incremental revenue from subscribers who pay the ad-free upcharge. Bank of America analysts estimate that Amazon couldrakein $3 billion in advertising revenue this year from Prime Video, potentially up to $5 billion when including those users who pay the additional charge. Morgan Stanley is a bit moreoptimisticabout Amazon’s new initiative forecasting $3.3 billion this year, $5.2 billion in 2025 and $7.1 billion in 2026, generating an additional $2.3 billion in EBITDA in 2024. We see a more conservative take from MoffetNathanson, which projects just $1.3 billion in ad revenue this year before rising to $2.3 billion in 2025, with ~$500 million from users paying the ad-free upcharge.Unlocking Value via AWS, AdsAWS and advertising are poised to exit 2024 at a combined $160 billion annualized run rate, or ~25% of Amazon’s estimated FY24 revenue. The two segments may help unlock more value for Amazon, given the gross and operating margin expansion the two segments are driving.Take AWS – at $100 billion plus ARR, it’s the largest cloud provider compared to Azure at $76 billion ARR, Google Cloud at $38 billion and Oracle at $20 billion. Though AWS’ growth is lower at 17% versus >25% for rivals, it has one of the strongest margin profiles, with a 37.6% operating margin in Q1 and a 30.6% TTM operating margin.AWS has one of the strongest margin profiles among rival hyperscalers, with a 37.6% operating margin... [+]in Q1 and a 30.6% TTM operating margin.I/O FundIn a sum-of-the-parts view, AWS could be worth $900 billion: this assumes a fair ~9x sales multiple, or a 30x earnings multiple, given that AWS may potentially generate a ~50% YoY increase to ~$30 billion in net income on a 75% YoY increase in operating income towards $40 billion. These multiples are conservatively in-line with current market valuations in cloud and AI – Microsoft trades at 13x forward sales and 33x forward earnings for 17% company wide growth, and Oracle at 6x forward sales and 21x forward earnings for single-digit growth.Turning to ads, as the segment approaches a $60 billion run rate by the end of the year, it could fetch a $360 billion value in a similar sum-of-the-parts look. With growth likely remaining above 20%, this is again a conservatively fair market multiple of 6x forward sales, compared to a 7.6x forward sales multiple for Meta and a 6x forward sales multiple for Google.Combined, Amazon’s two fastest growing segments could be viewed as worth at least $1.26 trillion, while also driving significant gross margin and operating margin expansion. When combined with Amazon’s remaining e-commerce and subscription businesses, which could be worth $1.2 trillion at a 2.5x multiple (a 30% discount to Amazon’s 5-year average 3.3x multiple) on an estimated ~$480 billion in revenue in 2024, there is room for Amazon’s valuation to expand towards the $2.5 trillion threshold. However, this outlook is reliant on AWS maintaining this revenue acceleration, as well as ads & AWS driving continual margin expansion.Valuation Intact, Strong Cash Flow GrowthAmazon’s valuation is not at peak levels, with shares trading far below historical highs, unlike Microsoft which is trading at ‘Mount Everest’ valuations in regards to historical valuation multiples.Amazon currently trades in line with its 5-year average PS ratio of nearly 3.4x, and at about 3.1x forward PS — although this is a significant increase from the 1.6x multiples at the start of 2023, Amazon’s forward PS ratio is 10% lower than early 2022.Amazon currently trades in line with its 5-year average PS ratio of nearly 3.4x, and at about 3.1x... [+]forward PS.YChartsDue to strong growth on the bottom line, Amazon is cheap on PE basis for this stock. The current PE Ratio of 52 is one of the lowest we’ve seen in the past few years, and is comfortably below the 3-year median of 67 and the 5-year median of 78. In fact, Amazon is cheaper now than it was in October 2023, despite a nearly 60% rally in shares since then.Due to strong growth on the bottom line, Amazon is cheap on a PE basis for this stockYChartsEarnings growth and operating cash flow growth are both expected to be strong in 2024 and extend into 2025. Amazon isestimatedto report more than 56% growth in EPS this year to $4.52 before rising another 27% to $5.74 in 2025. Operating cash flow is projected to increase 45.5% to $123.6 billion in 2024 before rising another 19% to $147.4 billion in 2025.ConclusionIn a 2022 webinar entitled “The New Kings of Tech,” our firm discussed that the first wave of AI gains will be realized in the enterprise space. We also recently debatedon Real Visionthat Big Tech has an undeniable advantage in AI due to possessing the capital to make the required hardware investments, and having an immediate product-market fit with their current in-house segments. Meanwhile, mid cap companies and small startups have to find customers for their AI products, and those SMB customers must be willing to absorb the high costs of AI. Meanwhile, Amazon is well positioned to capitalize on surging generative AI demand quickly with a multi-billion dollar run rate in AWS from AI products already. Combined with advertising, the two are driving strong margin expansion and aiding in both top and bottom-line growth; and in turn, this growth is creating an attractive valuation on the bottom line.The I/O Fund has recently detailed the firm’s favorite AI stocks for premium members.

The company attributed the boost to artificial intelligence and advertising sales.Amazon reported overall revenue of $143.3bn in the first three months of the year – up 13% from the same period in 2023 and surpassing Wall Street expectations of $142.65bn. The e-commerce giant reported an increase of more than 200% to $15bn, with net income more than tripling to $10.4bn from $3.17bn at the same time in 2023.Meta says revenue will be weak as it spends even more on AIRead moreIn a statement accompanying the report, the chief executive, Andy Jassy, said Amazon’s continuing focus on AI has “reaccelerat[ed]” the growth rate of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud-computing sector. Revenue at AWS increased 17% year-over-year to $25bn, and AWS accounted for 62% of total operating profit. In a call following the report, Jassy said Amazon still has a lot of room to grow in the generative AI sector.The boost to AWS comes after growth in the sector had slowed recently. Executives attributed the slump to recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, which had pushed many companies to improve cloud infrastructure to support remote work. That trend is stabilizing, they said, and demand for AI can further boost its cloud services.“We remain very bullish in AWS,” Jassy said. “We’re at a $100bn-dollar annualized revenue run right now, and this is before you even calculate generative AI. There’s a very large opportunity in front of us.”Advertising sales, meanwhile, increased 24% year-over-year to $11.8bn, after the company expanded its advertising, including rolling out ads on Prime Video, startingearlier this year.As Amazon ramps up its cloud-computing and AI capabilities, it will need to spend more on infrastructure to support the technology, Jassy said on the investor call Tuesday. Capital expenditure (capex) was at $14bn for the quarter, and Jassy said it is expected to increase in subsequent quarters of the fiscal year.“The more demand AWS has, the more we have to procure new data centers’ power and hardware,” he said, adding that the company does not spend capital “without very clear signals that we can monetize it”. Last week,Meta’s shares plummetedon news that the company would increase its capital expenditure to build up its AI capabilities.The earnings report comes after Amazon announced itwould invest$11bn to build more data centers in Indiana, promising at least 1,000 jobs there. Also in the quarter, the companyextendedits partnership with chip manufacturer Nvidia to continue to power its AI offerings.The report underscores a positive response from investors to Amazon’s recent cost-cutting measures, including laying off more than 27,000 employees since late 2022. Amazon laid offhundreds of additional staffersin early 2024.Shares were up 5% in after-hours trading.Explore more on these topicsAmazonQuarterly resultsE-commerceInternetArtificial intelligence (AI)Cloud computingnewsShareReuse this content',\n",
       "   'Off-Prem3AWS hits $100B revenue run rate, expands margins, delivers most of Amazon\\'s profit3Growth is rather slower than cloudy rivals, but boss Andy Jassy can explain thatSimon SharwoodWed\\xa01\\xa0May\\xa02024//06:00\\xa0UTCAmazon Web Services is on track to earn $100 billion of revenue in FY2024, has improved its margins, and provides the bulk of its parent company\\'s operating income.News of the cloudy concern\\'s performance arrived on Tuesday with Amazon.com\\'s Q1 results, which featured sales of $143.3 billion – up 13 percent year on year – $10.4 billion of net income and operating income of $15.3 billion.AWS sales improved 17 percent year-on-year to land at $25 billion, $9.4 billion of which was operating income – a profit metric that omits some of the costs used to calculate net income. Do the math, people: 17 percent of Amazon revenue comes from AWS, but the cloudy concern produces 65.7 percent of the overall group\\'s operating income.Improved AWS margins helped: the unit improved by 800 basis points, or eight percent.CEO Andy Jassy felt the need to explain AWS\\'s growth rate – perhaps because Microsoft and Google recently reported cloudy growth of 31 percent and 28 percent respectively.\"It\\'s useful to remember that year-over-year percentages are only relevant relative to the total base from which you start,\" Jassy told investors on Amazon\\'s earnings call. \"And given our much larger infrastructure cloud computing base, at this growth rate, we see more absolute dollar growth again quarter-over-quarter in AWS than we can see elsewhere.\"Which is nice, Andy. But if your rivals grow faster than you their base numbers are also growing. Just saying.Jassy of course sees better days ahead for AWS, for two reasons.One is that generative AI is a new class of workload that he believes will largely be run in the cloud. AWS is doing what it takes to be a player, with Amazon capex – which came in at $48.3 billion for FY2023 – predicted \"to meaningfully increase year-over-year in 2024, primarily driven by higher infrastructure capex to support growth in AWS, including generative AI.\" Another way the biz will cash in on generative AI is by launching its own services powered by the tech – and, as if on cue, Tuesday also saw the general availability of theAmazon Qchatbot that was announced last year.The other reason Jassy thinks AWS will keep growing is that the post-pandemic era of customers focusing their efforts on cloud cost optimization has just about ended.\"Companies have largely completed the lion\\'s share of their cost optimization and turned their attention to newer initiatives,\" Jassy explained. \"Before the pandemic, companies were marching to modernize their infrastructure, moving from on-premises infrastructure to the cloud to save money, innovated at a more rapid rate, and to drive more developer productivity. The pandemic and uncertain economy that followed distracted from that momentum, but it\\'s picking up again.\"Elon Musk\\'s latest brainfart is to turn Tesla cars into AWS on wheelsThe hyper-clouds are open source\\'s friendsBig Cloud is still making bank – Is this AI adoption, price rises, or what?Amazon to ditch WorkDocs sharing service, support countdown beginsThe CEO also noted that 85 percent of current IT spend is for on-prem tech. So AWS has plenty of room for growth even as it approaches $100 billion annual revenue.For perspective, Dell\\'s full year revenue for FY24 was $88.4 billion – down from $102.3 billion the year before. Even at 17 percent growth, AWS is doing far better. Among enterprise players, only Microsoft makes more revenue, while among tech companies Google and Apple lie even further ahead.Amazon predicted Q2 sales of between $144.0 billion and $149.0 billion – growth of seven to eleven percent year on year.Investors were a little disappointed by that guidance, and Amazon\\'s share price followed the NASDAQ as the index eased a couple of points across the day – then dropped around another point after the bell.One more thing: AWS\\'s huge operating income number was attributed, in part, to its decision torun servers for six years. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told investors that decision \"primarily benefits the AWS segment\" – perhaps a sign that the cloudy business unit runs more tin than Amazon itself? ®Get ourTech ResourcesShareMore aboutAlabamaAmazonAWSMore like these×More aboutAlabamaAmazonAWSCloud ComputingNarrower topicsAWS GravitonAzureCloud nativeContent delivery networkDigital OceanEbookEC2Edge ComputingFinOpsGoogle Cloud PlatformG SuiteHybrid CloudIaaSiCloudKindleKubernetesMulticloudPaasPrivate CloudPublic CloudS3ServerlessSystems ApproachVirtualizationvSphereBroader topicsJeff BezosUnited States of AmericaMore aboutShare3COMMENTSMore aboutAlabamaAmazonAWSMore like these×More aboutAlabamaAmazonAWSCloud ComputingNarrower topicsAWS GravitonAzureCloud nativeContent delivery networkDigital OceanEbookEC2Edge ComputingFinOpsGoogle Cloud PlatformG SuiteHybrid CloudIaaSiCloudKindleKubernetesMulticloudPaasPrivate CloudPublic CloudS3ServerlessSystems ApproachVirtualizationvSphereBroader topicsJeff BezosUnited States of AmericaTIP US OFFSend us news'],\n",

It was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924 and soon became the leading manufacturer ofpunch-card tabulating systems. During the 1960s and 1970s, theIBM mainframe, exemplified by theSystem/360, was the world\\'s dominantcomputing platform, with the company producing 80 percent of computers in the U.S. and 70 percent of computers worldwide.[11]IBM debuted in themicrocomputermarket in 1981 with theIBM Personal Computer, — itsDOSsoftware provided byMicrosoft, — which became the basis for the majority ofpersonal computersto the present day.[12]The company later also found success in theportablespace with theThinkPad. Since the 1990s, IBM has concentrated oncomputer services,software,supercomputers, andscientific research; it sold its microcomputer division toLenovoin 2005. IBM continues to develop mainframes, and its supercomputers haveconsistently rankedamong the most powerful in the world in the 21st century.As one of the world\\'s oldest and largest technology companies, IBM has been responsible for severaltechnological innovations, including theAutomated Teller Machine(ATM),Dynamic Random-Access Memory(DRAM), thefloppy disk, thehard disk drive, themagnetic stripe card, therelational database, theSQL programming language, and theUniversal Product Code(UPC) barcode. The company has made inroads in advancedcomputer chips,quantum computing,artificial intelligence, anddata infrastructure.[13][14][15]IBM employees and alumni have won various recognitions for their scientific research and inventions, including sixNobel Prizesand sixTuring Awards.[16]History[edit]Main article:History of IBM1910s–1950s[edit]IBM originated with several technological innovations developed and commercialized in the late 19th century. Julius E. Pitrap patented the computing scale in 1885;[17]Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);[18]Herman Hollerithpatented theElectric Tabulating Machine(1889);[19]andWillard Bundyinvented atime clockto record workers\\' arrival and departure times on a paper tape (1889).[20]On June 16, 1911, their four companies wereamalgamatedin New York State byCharles Ranlett Flintforming a fifth company, theComputing-Tabulating-Recording Company(CTR) based in Endicott, New York.[1][21]The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott andBinghamton, New York;Dayton, Ohio;Detroit, Michigan;Washington, D.C.; andToronto, Canada.[22]Collectively, the companies manufactured a wide array of machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards.Thomas J. Watson, Sr., fired from theNational Cash Register CompanybyJohn Henry Patterson, called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered a position at CTR.[23]Watson joined CTR as general manager and then, 11 months later, was made President whenantitrustcases relating to his time at NCR were resolved.[24]Having learned Patterson\\'s pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR\\'s companies.[23]:\\u200a105He implemented sales conventions, \"generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker\".[25][26]His favorite slogan, \"THINK\", became a mantra for each company\\'s employees.[25]During Watson\\'s first four years, revenues reached $9\\xa0million ($158\\xa0million today) and the company\\'s operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.[25]Watson never liked the clumsy hyphenated name \"Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company\" and chose to replace it with the more expansive title \"International Business Machines\" which had previously been used as the name of CTR\\'s Canadian Division;[27]the name was changed on February 14, 1924.[28]By 1933, most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.[29]NACAresearchers using anIBM type 704electronic data processing machine in 1957TheNazismade extensive use of Hollerith punch card and alphabetical accounting equipment and IBM\\'s majority-owned German subsidiary, Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen GmbH (Dehomag), supplied this equipment from the early 1930s. This equipment was critical to Nazi efforts to categorize citizens of both Germany and other nations that fell under Nazi control through ongoing censuses. These census data were used to facilitate the round-up of Jews and other targeted groups, and to catalog their movements through the machinery of theHolocaust, including internment in the concentration camps.[30]Nazi concentration camps operated a Hollerith department called Hollerith Abteilung, which had IBM machines, including calculating and sorting machines.[31]IBM as a military contractor produced 6% of theM1 Carbinerifles used in World War II, about 346,500 of them, between August 1943 and May 1944. IBM built theAutomatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, an electromechanical computer, during World War II. It offered its first commercial stored-program computer, the vacuum tube basedIBM 701, in 1952. TheIBM 305 RAMACintroduced the hard disk drive in 1956. The company switched to transistorized designs with the7000and1400series, beginning in 1958. In which, IBM considered the1400series the \\'\\'model T\\'\\' of computing, due to it being the first computer with over ten thousand sales by IBM.[citation needed]In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example ofartificial intelligencewhenArthur L. Samuelof IBM\\'sPoughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed anIBM 704not merely to play checkers but \"learn\" from its own experience. In 1957, theFORTRANscientific programming language was developed.[citation needed]1960s–1980s[edit]In 1961, IBM developed theSABRE reservation systemforAmerican Airlinesand introduced the highly successfulSelectrictypewriter.\\nAlso in 1961 IBM used theIBM 7094to generate the first song sung completely by a computer using synthesizers. The song was Daisy, Daisy (Bicycle built for two).In 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flights of theMercuryastronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City toArmonk, New York. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965Geminiflights, 1966 Saturn flights, and 1969 lunar mission. IBM also developed and manufactured theSaturn V\\'sInstrument Unit andApollospacecraft guidance computers.AnIBM System/360in use at theUniversity of Michiganc.1969IBM guidance computer hardware for theSaturn V Instrument UnitOn April 7, 1964, IBM launched the first computer system family, theIBM System/360. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by theIBM System/370in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made theIBM mainframethe dominantmainframe computerand the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They and the operating systems that ran on them such asOS/VS1andMVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as theCICStransaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level market share and became the thing IBM was most known for during this period.[32]In 1969, the United States of America alleged that IBM violated theSherman Antitrust Actby monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general-purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business, and subsequently alleged that IBM violated the antitrust laws in IBM\\'s actions directed against leasing companies and plug-compatible peripheral manufacturers. Shortly after, IBM unbundled its software and services in what many observers believed was a direct result of the lawsuit, creating a competitive market for software. In 1982, the Department of Justice dropped the case as \"without merit\".[33]Also in 1969, IBM engineerForrest Parryinvented themagnetic stripe cardthat would become ubiquitous for credit/debit/ATM cards, driver\\'s licenses, rapid transit cards and a multitude of other identity and access control applications. IBM pioneered the manufacture of these cards, and for most of the 1970s, the data processing systems and software for such applications ran exclusively on IBM computers. In 1974, IBM engineerGeorge J. Laurerdeveloped theUniversal Product Code.[34]IBM and theWorld Bankfirst introducedfinancial swapsto the public in 1981, when they entered into a swap agreement.[35]TheIBM Personal Computer(pictured)became one of IBM\\'s best selling products and has had a wideinfluence on personal computingsince its release in 1981.IBM entered themicrocomputermarket in the 1980s with theIBM Personal Computer(IBM 5150). The computer, which spawned along line of successors, had a profoundinfluence on the development of the personal computer marketand became one of IBM\\'s best selling products of all time. Due to a lack of foresight by IBM,[36][37]the PC was not well protected byintellectual propertylaws. As a consequence, IBM quickly began losing its market dominance to emerging,compatiblecompetitors in the PC market.In 1985, IBM collaborated withMicrosoftto develop a newoperating system, which was released asOS/2. Following a dispute, Microsoft severed the collaboration and IBM continued development of OS/2 on its own but it failed in the marketplace against Microsoft\\'sWindowsduring the mid-1990s.1990s–2000s[edit]In 1991 IBM began spinning off its many divisions into autonomous subsidiaries (so-called \"Baby Blues\") in an attempt to make the company more manageable and to streamline IBM by having other investors finance those companies.[38][39]These includedAdStar, dedicated to disk drives and other data storage products; IBM Application Business Systems, dedicated to mid-range computers; IBM Enterprise Systems, dedicated to mainframes; Pennant Systems, dedicated to mid-range and large printers;Lexmark, dedicated to small printers; and more.[40]Lexmark was acquired byClayton & Dubilierin aleveraged buyoutshortly after its formation.[41]In September 1992, IBM completed the spin-off of their various non-mainframe and non-midrange, personal computer manufacturing divisions, combining them into an autonomous wholly owned subsidiary known as the IBM Personal Computer Company (IBM PC Co.).[42][43]This corporate restructuring came after IBM reported a sharp drop in profit margins during the second quarter of fiscal year 1992; market analysts attributed the drop to a fierce price war in the personal computer market over the summer of 1992.[44]The corporate restructuring was one of the largest and most expensive in history up to that point.[45]By the summer of 1993, the IBM PC Co. had divided into multiple business units itself, includingAmbra Computer Corporationand the IBM Power Personal Systems Group, the former an attempt to design and market \"clone\" computers of IBM\\'s own architecture and the latter responsible for IBM\\'sPowerPC-basedworkstations.[46][47]IBM PC Co. introduced theThinkPadclone computers, which IBM would heavily market and would eventually become one of the best-selling series ofnotebook computers.[48]In 1993, IBM posted an $8\\xa0billion loss – at the time the biggest in American corporate history.[49]Lou Gerstnerwas hired as CEO fromRJR Nabiscoto turn the company around.[50]In 1995, IBM purchasedLotus Software, best known for itsLotus 1-2-3spreadsheet software.[51]During the decade, IBM was working on a new operating system, named theWorkplace OSproject. Despite a large amount of money spent on the project, it was cancelled in 1996.IBM inventions (clockwise from top-left): thehard-disk drive,DRAM, theUPC bar code, and themagnetic stripe cardIn 1998, IBM merged the enterprise-oriented Personal Systems Group of the IBM PC Co. into IBM\\'s own Global Services personal computer consulting and customer service division. The resulting merged business units then became known simply as IBM Personal Systems Group.[52]A year later, IBM stopped selling their computers at retail outlets after their market share in this sector had fallen considerably behind competitorsCompaqandDell.[53]Immediately afterwards, the IBM PC Co. was dissolved and merged into IBM Personal Systems Group.[54]In 2002 IBM acquired PwC Consulting, the consulting arm ofPwCwhich was merged into itsIBM Global Services.[55][56]On September 14, 2004,LGand IBM announced that their business alliance in theSouth Koreanmarket would end at the end of that year. Both companies stated that it was unrelated to the charges of bribery earlier that year.[57][58][59][60]Xnotewas originally part of the joint venture and was sold by LG in 2012.[61]Continuing a trend started in the 1990s of downsizing its operations and divesting fromcommodity production, IBMsold all of its personal computer businessto Chinese technology companyLenovo[62]and, in 2009, it acquired software companySPSS Inc.Later in 2009, IBM\\'sBlue Genesupercomputing program was awarded theNational Medal of Technology and Innovationby U.S. PresidentBarack Obama.2010s–present[edit]In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence programWatson, which was exhibited onJeopardy!where it won against game-show champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. The company also celebrated its 100th anniversary in the same year on June 16. In 2012, IBM announced it had agreed to buyKenexaand Texas Memory Systems,[63]and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies, aweb hosting service, in a deal worth around $2\\xa0billion.[64]Also that year, the company designed a video surveillance system forDavao City.[65]In 2014 IBM announced it would sell itsx86server division to Lenovo for $2.1\\xa0billion.[66]while continuing to offerPower ISA-based servers.[67]Also that year, IBM began announcing several major partnerships with other companies, includingApple Inc.,[68][69]Twitter,[70]Facebook,[71]Tencent,[72]Cisco,[73]UnderArmour,[74]Box,[75]Microsoft,[76]VMware,[77]CSC,[78]Macy\\'s,[79]Sesame Workshop,[80]the parent company ofSesame Street, andSalesforce.com.[81]In 2015, its chip division transitioned to afablessmodel withsemiconductorsdesign, offloading manufacturing toGlobalFoundries.[82]In 2015, IBM announced three major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion,[83]data storage vendorCleversafe, and all digital assets fromThe Weather Company, includingWeather.comandThe Weather Channelmobile app.[84][85]Also that year, IBM employees created the filmA Boy and His Atom, which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016, IBM acquired video conferencing serviceUstreamand formed a new cloud video unit.[86][87]In April 2016, it posted a 14-year low in quarterly sales.[88]The following month,Grouponsued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.[89]In 2015, IBM bought the digital part ofThe Weather Company,[90]Truven Health Analytics for $2.6\\xa0billion in 2016, and in October 2018, IBM announced its intention to acquireRed Hatfor $34\\xa0billion,[91][92][93]which was completed on July 9, 2019.[94]In February 2020, IBM\\'sJohn Kelly IIIjoinedBrad SmithofMicrosoftto sign a pledge with theVaticanto ensure the ethical use and practice ofArtificial Intelligence (AI).[95]IBM announced in October 2020 that it would divest the Managed Infrastructure Services unit of its Global Technology Services division into a new public company.[96]The new company,Kyndryl, will have 90,000 employees, 4,600 clients in 115 countries, with a backlog of $60\\xa0billion.[97][98][99]IBM\\'s spin off was greater than any of its previous divestitures, and welcomed by investors.[100][101][102]IBM appointed Martin Schroeter, who had been IBM\\'s CFO from 2014 through the end of 2017, as CEO of Kyndryl.[103][104]In 2021, IBM announced the acquisition of the enterprise software companyTurbonomicfor $1.5\\xa0billion.[105]In January 2022, IBM announced it would sellWatson Healthto private equity firmFrancisco Partners.[106]On March 7, 2022, a few days after the start of theRussian invasion of Ukraine, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna published a Ukrainian flag and announced that \"we have suspended all business in Russia\". All Russian articles were also removed from the IBM website.[107]On June 7, Krishna announced that IBM would carry out an \"orderly wind-down\" of its operations in Russia.[108]In late 2022, IBM started a collaboration with new Japanese manufacturerRapidus,[109]which led GlobalFoundries to file a lawsuit against IBM the following year.[110]In 2023, IBM acquired Manta Software Inc. to complement its data and A.I. governance capabilities for an undisclosed amount.[111]On November 16, 2023, IBM suspended ads on Twitter after ads were found next to pro-Nazi content.[112][113]In December 2023, IBM announced it would acquireSoftware AG\\'s StreamSets andwebMethodsplatforms for €2.13 billion ($2.33 billion).[114]Corporate affairs[edit]Business trends[edit]IBM\\'s market capitalization was valued at over $153\\xa0billion as of May 2024.[115]Despite its relative decline within the technology sector,[116]IBM remains the seventh largest technology company by revenue, and 67thlargest overall company by revenue in the United States. IBM ranked No. 38 on the 2020Fortune 500rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[117]In 2014, IBM was accused of using \"financial engineering\" to hit its quarterly earnings targets rather than investing for the longer term.[118][119][120]The key trends of IBM are (as at the financial year ending December 31):[121][122]YearRevenue(US$ bn)Net income(US$ bn)Employees201492.712.0379,592201581.713.1377,757201679.911.8380,300201779.15.7366,600201879.58.7350,600201977.19.4352,600202073.65.5345,9002021[b]57.35.7282,100202260.51.6288,300202361.87.5282,200Board and shareholders[edit]See also:List of IBM CEOsThe company\\'s 15-member board of directors are responsible for overall corporate management and includes the current or former CEOs ofAnthem,Dow Chemical,Johnson and Johnson,Royal Dutch Shell,UPS, andVanguardas well as the president ofCornell Universityand a retiredU.S. Navy admiral.[123]Vanguard Group is the largest shareholder of IBM and as of March 31, 2023, held 15.7% of total shares outstanding.[124]In 2011, IBM became the first technology companyWarren Buffett\\'sholding companyBerkshire Hathawayinvested in.[125]Initially he bought 64\\xa0million shares costing $10.5\\xa0billion. Over the years, Buffett increased his IBM holdings, but by the end of 2017 had reduced them by 94.5% to 2.05\\xa0million shares; by May 2018, he was completely out of IBM.[126]Headquarters and offices[edit]See also:List of IBM facilitiesPangu Plaza, one of IBM\\'s offices in Beijing, ChinaIBM is headquartered inArmonk, New York, a community 37 miles (60\\xa0km) north of Midtown Manhattan.[127]A nickname for the company is the \"Colossus of Armonk\".[128]Its principal building, referred to as CHQ, is a 283,000-square-foot (26,300\\xa0m2) glass and stone edifice on a 25-acre (10\\xa0ha) parcel amid a 432-acre former apple orchard the company purchased in the mid-1950s.[129]There are two other IBM buildings within walking distance of CHQ: the North Castle office, which previously served as IBM\\'s headquarters; and the Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., Center for Learning[130](formerly known as IBM Learning Center (ILC)), a resort hotel and training center, which has 182 guest rooms, 31 meeting rooms, and various amenities.[131]IBM operates in 174 countries as of 2016[update],[2]with mobility centers in smaller market areas and major campuses in the larger ones. In New York City, IBM has several offices besides CHQ, including theIBM Watsonheadquarters atAstor Placein Manhattan. Outside of New York, major campuses in the United States includeAustin, Texas;Research Triangle Park (Raleigh-Durham), North Carolina;Rochester, Minnesota; andSilicon Valley, California.IBM\\'s real estate holdings are varied and globally diverse. Towers occupied by IBM include1250 René-Lévesque(Montreal, Canada) andOne Atlantic Center(Atlanta, Georgia, US). In Beijing, China, IBM occupiesPangu Plaza,[132]the city\\'s seventh tallest building and overlookingBeijing National Stadium (\"Bird\\'s Nest\"), home to the2008 Summer Olympics.IBM India Private Limitedis the Indian subsidiary of IBM, which is headquartered atBangalore, Karnataka.

The company\\'s contributions to industrial architecture and design include works byMarcel Breuer,Eero Saarinen,Ludwig Mies van der Rohe,I.M. PeiandRicardo Legorreta. Van der Rohe\\'s building in Chicago was recognized with the 1990Honor Awardfrom theNational Building Museum.[134]Products[edit]See also:List of IBM productsBlue Genewas awarded theNational Medal of Technology and Innovationin 2009.IBM has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services. As of 2016[update], these offerings fall into the categories ofcloud computing, artificial intelligence,commerce,dataandanalytics,Internet of things(IoT),[135]IT infrastructure,mobile, digital workplace[136]andcybersecurity.[137]Hardware[edit]Mainframe computers[edit]Since 1954, IBM sellsmainframe computers, the latest being theIBM zseries. The most recent model, theIBM z16, was released in 2022.Microprocessors[edit]In 1990, IBM released thePower microprocessors, which were designed into many console gaming systems, includingXbox 360,[138]PlayStation 3, andNintendo\\'sWii U.[139][140]IBMSecure Blueis encryption hardware that can be built into microprocessors,[141]and in 2014, the company revealedTrueNorth, aneuromorphicCMOSintegrated circuitand announced a $3\\xa0billion investment over the following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10\\xa0billion neurons and 100\\xa0trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power.[142]In 2016, the company launchedall-flash arraysdesigned for small and midsized companies, which includes software for data compression, provisioning, and snapshots across various systems.[143]Quantum Computing[edit]IBM Q System One(2019), the first circuit-based commercial quantum computerIn January 2019, IBM introduced its first commercial quantum computer:IBM Q System One.[144]In March 2020, it was announced that IBM will build Europe\\'s first quantum computer inEhningen, Germany. The center, to be operated by theFraunhofer Society, was still in construction as of 2023, with cloud access planned in 2024.[145][146]Software[edit]Since 2009, IBM ownsSPSS, a software package used forstatistical analysisin thesocial sciences.[147]IBM also ownsThe Weather Company, which provides weather forecasting and includesweather.comandWeather Underground.[148]Cloud services[edit]IBM Cloudincludesinfrastructure as a service(IaaS),software as a service(SaaS) andplatform as a service(PaaS) offered through public, private and hybridcloud delivery models. For instance, the IBMBluemixPaaS enables developers to quickly create complex websites on a pay-as-you-go model. IBMSoftLayeris adedicated server,managed hostingandcloud computingprovider, which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81,000 servers for more than 26,000 customers.[149]IBM also provides Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), usingcryptographic splittingto secure customer data.[150]In May 2022, IBM announced the company had signed a multi-year Strategic Collaboration Agreement withAmazon Web Servicesto make a wide variety of IBM software available as a service on AWS Marketplace. Additionally, the deal includes both companies making joint investments that make it easier for companies to consume IBM\\'s offering and integrate them with AWS, including developer training and software development for select markets.[151]Artificial intelligence[edit]IBM Watsonis a technology platform that usesnatural language processingand machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts ofunstructured data.[152]Watson was debuted in 2011 on the American game showJeopardy!, where it competed against championsKen JenningsandBrad Rutterin a three-game tournament and won. Watson has since been applied to business, healthcare, developers, and universities. For example, IBM has partnered withMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centerto assist with considering treatment options foroncologypatients and for doingmelanomascreenings.[153]Several companies use Watson for call centers, either replacing or assisting customer service agents.[154]IBM also provides infrastructure for theNew York City Police Departmentthrough theirIBM Cognos Analyticsto perform data visualizations ofCompStatcrime data.[155]In June 2020, IBM announced that it was exiting the facial recognition business. In a letter to congress,[156]IBM\\'s Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna told lawmakers, \"now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies.\"[157]In May 2023, IBM revealedWatsonx, aGenerative AItoolkit that is powered by IBM\\'s ownGranitemodels with option to use other publicly availableLLMs. Watsonx has multiple services for training andfine tuningmodels based on confidential data.[158]A year later, IBMopen-sourcedGranite code models and put them onHugging Facefor public use.[159]In October 2024, IBM introduced Granite 3.0, an open-source large language model designed for enterprise AI applications.[160]Consulting[edit]Main article:IBM ConsultingWith 160,000 consultants globally as of 2024, it is one of the ten largest consulting companies in the world with capabilities spanning strategy andmanagement consulting, experience design, technology andsystems integration, and operations.[161]IBM\\'s consulting business was valued at $20 billion, as of 2024.[162]Research[edit]TheThomas J. Watson Research CenterinYorktown Heights, New York, is one of 12 IBM research labs worldwide.IBM FellowBenoit Mandelbrotdiscussesfractal geometry, 2010.Research has been part of IBM since its founding, and its organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945, when the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded atColumbia Universityin New York City, converting a renovated fraternity house on Manhattan\\'s West Side into IBM\\'s first laboratory. Now,IBM Researchconstitutes the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 12 labs on 6 continents.[163]IBM Research is headquartered at theThomas J. Watson Research Centerin New York, and facilities include theAlmaden labin California, Austin lab in Texas,Australia labin Melbourne,Brazil labin São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, China lab in Beijing and Shanghai, Ireland lab in Dublin,Haifa labin Israel, India lab in Delhi andBangalore,Tokyo lab,Zurichlaband Africa lab inNairobi.In terms of investment, IBM\\'sR&Dexpenditure totals several billion dollars each year. In 2012, that expenditure was approximately $6.9\\xa0billion.[164]Recent allocations have included $1\\xa0billion to create a business unit forWatsonin 2014, and $3\\xa0billion to create a next-gen semiconductor along with $4\\xa0billion towards growing the company\\'s \"strategic imperatives\" (cloud, analytics, mobile, security, social) in 2015.[165]IBM has been a leading proponent of theOpen Source Initiative, and began supportingLinuxin 1998.[166]The company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on Linux through the IBMLinux Technology Center, which includes over 300Linux kerneldevelopers.[167]IBM has also released code under differentopen-source licenses, such as theplatform-independentsoftware frameworkEclipse(worth approximately $40\\xa0million at the time of the donation),[168]the three-sentence International Components for Unicode (ICU) license, and theJava-basedrelational database management system(RDBMS)Apache Derby. IBM\\'sopen sourceinvolvement has not been trouble-free, however (seeSCO v. IBM).Famousinventionsand developments by IBM include: theautomated teller machine (ATM),Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM), theelectronic keypunch, thefinancial swap, thefloppy disk, thehard disk drive, themagnetic stripe card, therelational database,RISC, theSABRE airline reservation system,SQL, theUniversal Product Code (UPC)bar code, and thevirtual machine. Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used ascanning tunneling microscopeto arrange 35individual xenon atomsto spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time.[169]A major part of IBM research is the generation ofpatents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM has been one of the world\\'s most prolific patent sources. In 2021, the company held the record for mostpatentsgenerated by a business for 29 consecutive years for the achievement.[170]Patents[edit]As of 2021, IBM holds the record for most annualU.S.patentsgenerated by a business for 29 consecutive years.[170][171][172]In 2001, IBM became the first company to generate more than 3,000 patents in one year, beating this record in 2008 with over 4,000 patents.[11]As of 2022, the company held 150,000 patents.[173]IBM has also been criticized as being apatent troll.[174][175][176]Brand and reputation[edit]IBM ads atJohn F. Kennedy International Airport, 2013IBM is nicknamedBig Bluepartly due to its blue logo and color scheme,[177][178]and also in reference to its formerde factodress codeof white shirts with blue suits.[177][179]The company logo has undergone several changes over the years, with its current \"8-bar\" logo designed in 1972 bygraphic designerPaul Rand.[180]It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not render narrow (as opposed to tall) stripes well. Aside from the logo, IBM usedHelveticaas a corporate typeface for 50 years, until it was replaced in 2017 by the custom-designedIBM Plex.IBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for theMasters Tournament, one of the fourmajor championshipsin professional golf, with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the firstiPhoneapp with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).[181]As a result, IBM CEOGinni Romettybecame the third female member of the Master\\'s governing body, theAugusta National Golf Club.[182]IBM is also a major sponsor in professional tennis, with engagements at theU.S. Open,Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and the French Open.[183]The company also sponsored theOlympic Gamesfrom 1960 to 2000,[184]and theNational Football Leaguefrom 2003 to 2012.[185]In Japan, IBM employees also have anAmerican footballteam complete with pro stadium, cheerleaders and televised games, competing in the JapaneseX-Leagueas the \"Big Blue\".[186]Environmental[edit]In 2004, concerns were raised related to IBM\\'s contribution in its early days to pollution in its original location inEndicott, New York.[187][188]IBM reported its totalCO2e emissions(direct and indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020 at 621 kilotons (-324 /-34.3% year-on-year).[189]In February 2021, IBM committed to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2030.[190]People and culture[edit]Employees[edit]New IBM employees being welcomed to a bootcamp at IBM Austin, 2015Employees demonstratingIBM Watsoncapabilities in aJeopardy!exhibition match on campus, 2011It is among theworld\\'s largest employers, with over 297,900 employees worldwide in 2022,[191]with about 160,000 of those beingtech consultants.[162]IBM\\'s leadership programs includeExtreme Blue, an internship program, and theIBM Fellowaward, offered since 1963 based on technical achievement.[192]Notable current and former employees[edit]Many IBM employees have achieved notability outside of work and after leaving IBM. In business, former IBM employees includeApple Inc.CEOTim Cook,[193]formerEDSCEO and politicianRoss Perot,MicrosoftchairmanJohn W.

Six IBM employees have won theTuring Award, including the first female recipientFrances E. Allen.[205]TenNational Medals of Technology (USA)and fiveNational Medals of Science (USA)have been awarded to IBM employees.Workplace culture[edit]Employees are often referred to as \"IBMers\". IBM\\'s culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a \"sincere\" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.[206]During IBM\\'s management transformation in the 1990s, CEOLouis V. Gerstner Jr.relaxed these codes, normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees.[207]The company\\'s culture has also given to different plays on the company acronym (IBM), with some saying it stands for \"I\\'ve Been Moved\" due to relocations and layoffs,[208]others saying it stands for \"I\\'m By Myself\" pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm,[209]and others saying it stands for \"I\\'m Being Mentored\" due to the company\\'s open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels.[210]The company has traditionally resistedlabor union organizing,[211]although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States.[212]See also[edit]List of electronics brandsList of largest Internet companiesList of largest manufacturing companies by revenueTech companies in the New York City metropolitan regionTop 100 US Federal ContractorsQuantum Energy Teleportationusing IBM superconducting computersNotes[edit]^As of 2024.^IBM\\'s financial statements from the 2021 annual report have adjusted revenue, income numbers, employee count for the previous years to account for discontinued operations related to the separation ofKyndryl.References[edit]^ab\"Certificate of Incorporation of Computing-Tabulating-Recording-Co\",Appendix to Hearings Before the Committee on Patents, House of Representatives, Seventy-Fourth Congress, on H.

Rockefeller\\'sStandard Oil, the modern company was formed in 1999 following the merger of Exxon andMobil. It isvertically integratedacross the entire oil and gas industry, as well as within its chemicals division, which produces plastic, synthetic rubber, and other chemical products. As the largest U.S.-based oil and gas company, ExxonMobil is theseventh-largest company by revenue in the U.S.and13th-largest in the world. It is the largest investor-owned oil company in the world.[9][10][11]Approximately 55.56% of the company\\'s shares are held by institutions, the largest of which as of 2019 wereThe Vanguard Group(8.15%),BlackRock(6.61%), andState Street Corporation(4.83%).Thecompany has been widely criticizedand sued, mostly for environmental incidents andits history of climate change denialagainst the scientific consensus that fossil fuels significantly contribute toglobal warming.[12]The company is responsible for many oil spills, the largest and most notable of which was the 1989Exxon Valdezoil spillinAlaskaand itself considered to be one of theworld\\'s worst oil spillsin terms of environmental damage.[13][14]The company has been the target of accusations of human rights violations, excessive influence onAmerican foreign policy, and its impact on developing countries.[15]History[edit]Main article:History of ExxonMobilExxonMobil traces its roots toVacuum Oil Company, founded in 1866. Vacuum Oil later was acquired byStandard Oilin 1879, divested from Standard in 1911 withits breakup, and merged by the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), later known asMobil, in 1931. After the 1911 breakup, Standard Oil continued to exist through its New Jersey subsidiary, sometimes shortened to Jersey Standard, and retained the Standard Oil name in much of the eastern United States. Jersey Standard grew by acquiringHumble Oilin the 1930s and became the dominant oil company on the world stage. The company\\'s lack of ownership over the Standard Oil name across the United States, however, prompted a name change to unify all of its brands under one name, choosing to name itself Exxon in 1972 over continuing to use three distinct brands ofEsso,Enco, and Humble.[16][17]In 1998, the two companies agreed to merge and form ExxonMobil, with the deal closing on November 30, 1999. The two companies cited lower oil prices and a better ability to compete with other state-owned oil companies outside of the United States likePemexandAramco. With the deal, the two companies practically merged, with the new company\\'s name containing both of the trade names of its immediate predecessors. However, the structure of the merger provided that Exxon was the surviving company and bought Mobil, rather than a new company being created.[17][18][19][20]Following the merger, Exxon\\'s NYSE ticker symbol was changed from \"XON\"[21]to \"XOM\".Operations[edit]ExxonMobil is the largest non-government-owned company in the energy industry and produces about 3% of the world\\'s oil and about 2% of the world\\'s energy.[22]ExxonMobil in Guyana crude oil drills  map image offshore regions, Guyana exports around 500,000 barrels per day in offshore regions.ExxonMobil isvertically integratedinto a number of global operating divisions. These divisions are grouped into three categories for reference purposes, though the company also has several standalone divisions, such as Coal & Minerals. It also owns hundreds of smaller subsidiaries such asXTO EnergyandSeaRiver Maritime. ExxonMobil also has a majority ownership stake inImperial Oil.[23]Upstream(oil exploration, extraction, shipping, and wholesale operations)Product Solutions (downstream, chemical)Low Carbon Solutions[24]Upstream[edit]The upstream division makes up the majority of ExxonMobil\\'s revenue, accounting for approximately 70% of it.[25]In 2021, ExxonMobil had about 30 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalents, as well as 38.1 billion cubic feet ofnatural gas.[26]In the United States, ExxonMobil\\'s petroleum exploration and production activities are concentrated in thePermian Basin,Bakken Formation,Woodford Shale,Caney Shale, and theGulf of Mexico. In addition, ExxonMobil has several gas developments in the regions ofMarcellus Shale,Utica Shale,Haynesville Shale,Barnett Shale, andFayetteville Shale. All natural gas activities are conducted by its subsidiary, XTO Energy. As of December 31, 2014, ExxonMobil owned 14.6\\xa0million acres (59,000\\xa0km2) in the United States, of which 1.7\\xa0million acres (6,900\\xa0km2) were offshore, 1.5\\xa0million acres (6,100\\xa0km2) of which were in the Gulf of Mexico.[27]In California, it has a joint venture calledAera Energy LLCwithShell Oil.

The share is now owned byPetroChinaandPertamina.[31][32]In March 2024, ExxonMobil discovered oil at the Stabroek block off the coast ofGuyanausing a drillship. By the end of 2027, it plans to have 6FPSOsat the block.[33]Oil was discovered off the coast of Angola in May 2024 in a well drilled from February to April in theKizomba Bdevelopment area.[34]Russia operations[edit]Until the2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, ExxonMobil held 85,000 acres (34,000\\xa0ha) in theSakhalin-Iproject through its subsidiaryExxon Neftegas. Together withRosneft, it has developed 63.6\\xa0million acres (257,000\\xa0km2) in Russia, including theEast-Prinovozemelsky field. After Russia\\'s 2022 invasion began, though, ExxonMobil announced it was fully pulling out of both Russia and Sakhalin-I, and launched a lawsuit against Russia\\'s federal government on August 30.[35]Australia operations[edit]In Australia, ExxonMobil held 1.7\\xa0million acres (6,900\\xa0km2), including 1.6\\xa0million acres (6,500\\xa0km2) offshore. It also operates the Longford Gas Conditioning Plant, and participates in the development ofGorgon LNGproject.Papua New Guinea operations[edit]In Papua New Guinea, it holds 1.1\\xa0million acres (4,500\\xa0km2), including thePNG Gasproject.[27]Product Solutions[edit]An ExxonMobil gas station inHiawassee, GeorgiaExxonMobil formed its Product Solutions division in 2022, combining its previously separate Downstream and Chemical divisions into a single company.[36]On Oct. 1 2024, Nigeria approved the $1.28 billion sale of Exxon Mobil\\'s onshore assets to Seplat Energy, more than two years after the deal was first agreed upon in February 2022[37]Downstream and Retail[edit]ExxonMobil markets products around the world under the brands ofExxon, Mobil, and Esso. Mobil is ExxonMobil\\'s primary retail gasoline brand in California,Florida,New York,New England,the Great Lakes, and theMidwest. Exxon is the primary brand in the rest of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas (shared with Mobil), and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. ExxonMobil has stations in 46 states, just behindShell USAand ahead ofPhillips 66, lacking a presence only inAlaska,Hawaii,Iowa, andKansas.[38]Outside of the United States, Esso and Mobil are primarily used, with Esso operating in 14 countries and Mobil operating in 29 countries and regions.[39]In Japan, ExxonMobil had a 22% stake in TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K., a refining company that merged intoEneosin 2017.[40][41]ExxonMobil\\'s primary retail brands worldwide are Exxon,Esso,Mobil, with the former being used exclusively in the United States and the latter two being used in most other countries where ExxonMobil operates. Esso is the only one of its brands not used widely in the United States. Since 2008, Mobil is the only brand for the company lubricants. Since 2018, ExxonMobil has operated aloyalty program, ExxonMobil Rewards+, where customers earn rewards points when filling up at its stations in the United States and later the United Kingdom.[42][43][44]Chemicals[edit]ExxonMobil Chemical is a petrochemical company that was created by merging Exxon\\'s and Mobil\\'s chemical industries in 1999. Its principal products include basicolefinsandaromatics,ethylene glycol,polyethylene, andpolypropylenealong with speciality lines such aselastomers,plasticizers,solvents, process fluids,oxo alcoholsandadhesiveresins. The company also produces synthetic lubricant base stocks as well as lubricant additives,propylenepackaging films andcatalysts. ExxonMobil is the largest producer of butyl rubber.[45]Infineum, a joint venture with Shell plc, is manufacturing and marketingcrankcaselubricant additives,fuel additives, and specialty lubricant additives, as well asautomatic transmission fluids,gear oils, and industrial oils.[46]Sponsorships[edit]Main article:Mobil 1Mobil 1, a brand of synthetic motor oil, is a major sponsor of multiple racing teams and as the official motor oil ofNASCARsince 2003.[47]ExxonMobil is currently in partnerships withOracle Red Bull RacinginFormula Oneand Kalitta Motorsports.[48][49][50]Refineries[edit]ExxonMobil operates 21 refineries worldwide, and the company claims 80% of its refining capacity is integrated with chemical or lube basestocks. ExxonMobil\\'s largest refinery overall is itsBeaumont Refineryand its second largest in the United States is itsBaytown Refinery, located inBaytown, Texas. Its second largest refinery overall is itsJurong Islandfacility inSingapore. ExxonMobil\\'s global average refining capacity was 4.6 million barrels per day, with the United States producing a plurality of the company\\'s refining capacity at about 1.77 million barrels per day. ExxonMobil\\'s corporate website claims it refines almost 5 million barrels per day.[51][52][53][54]ExxonMobil was one of few U.S. refiners to expand capacity by a significant margin following an industry downturn suffered during theCOVID-19pandemic.[55]The company completed a 250,000 barrels per day expansion at itsBeaumont, Texas, refinery in early 2023.[56]Low Carbon Solutions[edit]Officially formed with ExxonMobil\\'s 2022 corporate restructuring, and currently led by formerGeneral MotorspresidentDan Ammann, Low Carbon Solutions is the company\\'s alternative energy division. The division says it will lower emissions in hard-to-decarbonize sectors such as heavy industry, commercial transportation, and power generation using a combination of lower-emission fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Low Carbon Solutions conducts research on clean energy technologies, includingalgae biofuels,biodieselmade from agricultural waste, carbonatefuel cells, and refining crude oil into plastic by using amembraneandosmosisinstead of heat.[57][58]The company speculated in April 2023 that pending good economic conditions, the low-carbon solutions business could eclipse the value of its oil and gas operations.[59]As of 2023[update], the company was in the process of designing its inaugural large-scale plant dedicated to producing low-carbon hydrogen, situated within its refining and petrochemical complex inBaytown, Texas. This project is set to become the world\\'s largest low-carbon hydrogen project.[60][61]Carbon capture and storage[edit]ExxonMobil publicly announced it would be investing $15 billion in what it deemed a \"lower carbon future\", and claims to be the world leader incarbon capture and storage(CCS). The company additionally plans that itsScope 1 and Scope 2emissions will becarbon neutralby 2050. ExxonMobil additionally acquired biofuel company Biojet AS in 2022, and its Canadian subsidiary Imperial Oil is moving ahead with plans to produce a renewable diesel biofuel.[62][63]In July 2023, Exxon agreed to acquireDenbury Resourcesfor $4.9 billion to further its low-carbon efforts.[64]In July 2024, ExxonMobil andCF Industriessigned a CCS agreement that will allow ExxonMobil to transport and permanently store 500,000 tonnes of CO2 per year starting in 2028.[65]Low-carbon energy projects[edit]Exxon is working on low-carbon energy projects, focusing on basic research in five to ten key areas. This work spends a fraction of the $1 billion a year Exxon spends on research worldwide and the $8 billion it has spent since 2000 researching, developing and deploying low-carbon technologies Projects include: algae biofuels, biodiesel from agricultural waste,molten carbonate fuel cells,\\nand new ways to manufacture plastic that produce less carbon dioxide.[66]Lithium mining[edit]In November 2023 ExxonMobil started drilling for lithium in the US State ofArkansas. In June 2024, a preliminary agreement to supply lithium toSKfor the manufacture oflithium-ion batteriesthat will powerelectric vehicleswas signed.[67]Controversies[edit]Main article:Criticism of ExxonMobilExtinction Rebellionprotestors demonstrating against ExxonMobilClimate change denial[edit]Further information:ExxonMobil climate change denialExxonMobil\\'s environmental recordhas faced much criticismfor its stance[68]and impact on global warming.[69]In 2018, thePolitical Economy Research Instituteranks ExxonMobil tenth among American corporations emittingairborne pollutants,[70]thirteenth by emittinggreenhouse gases.[71]A 2017 report places ExxonMobil as the fifth largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions from 1988 to 2015.[72][73]As of 2005[update], ExxonMobil had committed less than 1% of their profits towards researching alternative energy,[74]which, according to theadvocacy organizationCeres, is less than other leading oil companies.[75][needs update]According to the 2021 Arctic Environmental Responsibility Index (AERI), ExxonMobil is ranked as the sixth most environmentally responsible company among 120 oil, gas, and mining companies involved in resource extraction north of the Arctic Circle.[76]As of 2020, ExxonMobil has been responsible for more than 3,000 oil spills and leakages which resulted in a loss of more than one barrel of oil, with the most in a single year being 484 spills in 2011.[77]Additionally, since 1965, ExxonMobil has released more than 40 billion tons ofcarbon dioxide pollution.[78]In 2023,Sciencejournal published a paper reporting that the global warming projections and models created by ExxonMobil\\'s own scientists between 1977 and 2003 had \"accurately\" projected and \"skillfully\" modeled global warming due to fossil fuel burning, and had reasonably estimated how much CO2would lead to dangerous warming. The authors of the paper concluded: \"Yet, whereas academic and government scientists worked to communicate what they knew to the public, ExxonMobil worked to deny it.\"[79][80]Between the 1980s and 2014, ExxonMobil was a notable denier of climate change, though the company officially changed its position in 2014 to acknowledge the existence of climate change. ExxonMobil\\'s prolonged response incited the creation of theExxon Knewmovement, which aims to hold the company accountable for various climate-related incidents. ExxonMobil has used its own website to attackExxon Knew, claiming that it is a coordinated effort to defame the company.[81][82][83]In December 2022,U.S. House Oversight and Reform CommitteeChairCarolyn MaloneyandU.S. House Oversight Environment SubcommitteeChairRo Khannasent a memorandum to all House Oversight and Reform Committee members summarizing additional findings from the committee\\'s investigation into thefossil fuel industry disinformationcampaign to obscure the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming. Upon reviewing internal company documents, they accused ExxonMobil along withBP,Chevron, andShellofgreenwashingtheirParis Agreementcarbon neutralitypledges while continuing long-term investment in fossil fuel production and sales, for engaging in a campaign to promote the use of natural gas as a clean energy source and bridge fuel to renewable energy, and of intimidating journalists reporting about the companies\\' climate actions and of obstructing the committee\\'s investigation, which ExxonMobil, Shell, and theAmerican Petroleum Institutedenied.[84][85][86]In the United States, as of 2024, dozens of states and localities have sued ExxonMobil on the base of its climate change denial.[12]Oil spills and plastic pollution[edit]Exxon Valdez oil spillcleanupExxonMobil\\'s operations have been subject to numerous oil spills both before and after the 1999 merger. The most widely publicized oil spill was the 1989Valdezoil spill, where an Exxon tanker discharged approximately 11 million U.S. gallons (42,000 m3) of oil intoPrince William Sound,[87]oiling 1,300 miles (2,100\\xa0km) of the remote Alaskan coastline. The spill remains the second largest in American history, only trailingBP\\'sDeepwater Horizonspillin theGulf of Mexico.[88]ExxonMobil was also responsible for various other oil spills across the world. Some of Exxon\\'s largest and most notable oil spills in the United States include long-lasting oil leaks totaling into an estimated 30 million gallon spill into New York City\\'sNewtown Creekover the course of a century by Exxon and other Standard Oil predecessors,[89]a 2011 oil spill which leaked 1,500 barrels of oil into theYellowstone River(resulting in about $135 million in damages),[90]and a 2012 1,900 barrel (80,000 gallon) spill from the company\\'sBaton Rouge Refineryin the rivers ofPoint Coupee Parish, Louisiana.[91]ExxonMobil\\'s actives in Louisiana in particular, especially itsBaton Rouge Refinery, have given the area the nickname ofCancer Alley. The company\\'s activities, along with other operations and refineries in the area, have been the source of increased cancer infections, lower air quality, and as seen by some, potential environmental racism committed by the company.[92][93]In May 2021, ExxonMobil topped the Plastic Waste Makers Index report published by the Minderoo Foundation of 20 petrochemical companies that manufactured 55 percent of thesingle-use plastic wastein the world in 2019 (which were part of a larger group of 100 petrochemical companies that manufactured 90 percent of the waste),[94][95]while in April 2022,California Attorney GeneralRob Bontaissued a subpoena to ExxonMobil for information related to the company\\'s role in overstating the effectiveness ofplastic recyclingin reducing plastic pollution as part of an industry campaign to promote plastic usage.[96][97][98]On September 23, 2024,California Attorney GeneralRob Bontafiled a lawsuit inSan Francisco County Superior Courtagainst ExxonMobil on behalf of the state ofCalifornia, alleging that the company carried out a \"decades-long campaign of deception\" and misled the public on the merits of plastic recycling; in response ExxonMobil said that California has an ineffective recycling system that officials have known about for decades.[99]Geopolitical influence and human rights violations[edit]See also:Conflict in the Niger DeltaFormer CEORex Tillersonas Secretary of State, with Saudi Crown PrinceMohammed bin Salman, May 2017ExxonMobil has also been accused of human rights violations and abusing its geopolitical influence.[15]In the bookPrivate EmpirebySteve Coll, ExxonMobil is described as extremely powerful \"corporate state within the American state\" in dealing with the countries in which it drills, going to the point as describing such countries\\' governments as \"constrained\".[100]The company\\'s corporate ancestors are also blamed for the outbreak of the 1954Jebel Akhdar War, which was sparked by theIraq Petroleum Company\\'s activities.[101][102]Indonesia[edit]Main article:Accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in AcehBeginning in the late 1980s, ExxonMobil (through predecessor Mobil) hired military units of theIndonesian National Armyto provide security for their gas extraction and liquefaction project inAceh, Indonesia, and these military units were accused of committing human rights violations, including sexual assault, battery and unlawful detention. ExxonMobil eventually pulled out from Indonesia completely in 2001, while denying any wrongdoing.[103]Exxon attempted to have the case dismissed nine times, dragging the lawsuit out for over 20 years.

       "   \"The United States became the world’s topcrude oilproducer in 2018 and maintained the lead position through 2022. U.S. oil refineries obtain crude oil produced in the United States and in other countries. Different types of companies supply crude oil to the world market. Crude oil is produced in 32 U.S. states and in U.S. coastal waters. In 2022, five states combined accounted for about 72% of total U.S. crude oil production. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration,Petroleum Supply Annual, Volume 1,Table 14, August 2023Note: Includes crude oil andlease condensate. Data for Alaska, California, Louisiana, and Texas include production in state-administered coastal waters. In 2022, about 14.5% of U.S. crude oil was produced from wells located in theFederal OffshoreGulf of Mexico and about 0.1% was produced in Federal Offshore Pacific (California). Althoughtotal U.S. crude oil productiongenerally declined between 1985 and 2008, annual production increased nearly each year from 2009 through 2019, reaching a record high in 2019. More cost-effective drilling technology helped to boost production, especially in Texas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Colorado. U.S crude oil production declined in 2020 and 2021, mainly because of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. In 2022, production increased about 6% from 2021. In 2022, 98 countries produced about 80.75 million barrels of crude oil, and five of those countries accounted for about 52% of the total. Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration,International Energy Statistics,Crude oil production including lease condensate, as of September 6, 2023. The world oil market is complex. Governments and private companies play various roles in moving crude oil from producers to consumers. In the United States, companies produce crude oil on private and public land and in offshore waters. Most of these companies areindependent producers, and they usually operate only in the United States. The other companies, often referred to asmajor oil companies, may have hundreds or thousands of employees and operate in many countries. Examples of major U.S. oil companies are Chevron and ExxonMobil. Three types of companies supply crude oil to the global oil market. Each type of company has different operational strategies and production-related goals. International oil companies (IOCs), which include ExxonMobil, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell, are entirely investor owned and are primarily interested in increasing value for their shareholders. As a result, IOCs tend to make investment decisions based on economic factors. IOCs typically move quickly to develop and produce the oil resources available to them and sell their output in the global market. Although these producers must follow the laws of the countries in which they produce oil, their decisions are ultimately made in the interest of the company and its shareholders, not in the interest of a government. National oil companies (NOCs) operate as extensions of a government or a government agency, and they include companies such as Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia), Pemex (Mexico), the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), and Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA). NOCs financially support government programs and sometimes provide strategic support. NOCs often provide fuels to their domestic consumers at a lower price than the fuels they provide to the international market. They do not always have the incentive, means, or intention to develop their reserves at the same pace as investor-owned international oil companies. Because of the diverse objectives of their supporting governments, NOCs pursue goals that may not be market oriented. The goals of NOCs often include employing citizens, furthering a government's domestic or foreign policies, generating long-term revenue to pay for government programs, and supplying inexpensive domestic energy. All NOCs that belong to members ofOPECfall into this category. These NOCs function as corporate entities and do not operate as extensions of their countries' governments. This category includes Petrobras (Brazil) and Statoil (Norway), among others. These companies often balance profit-oriented concerns and the objectives of their countries with the development of their corporate strategies. Although these companies are driven by commercial concerns, they may also take into account their nations' goals when making investment or other strategic decisions. OPECis a group that includes some of the world's most oil-rich countries. OPEC members at the beginning of 2021 held about 72% of the world's total proved crude oil reserves, and in 2022, accounted for about 38% of total world crude oil production. Each OPEC country has at least one NOC, but most also allow IOCs to operate within their borders. In 2022, the seven countries in the Persian Gulf produced about 32% of total world crude oil, and they held about 49% of world proved crude oil reserves at the start of 2021. OPECwas organized in 1960 to negotiate with oil companies on matters of oil production, prices, and future concession rights. Of the 13 OPEC member countries at the end of 2021, only 5 of them were Persian Gulf countries. The OPEC members in bold in the table below are also in the Persian Gulf.

Another predecessor wasStandard Oil Company of New York(Socony), established by the trust in 1882. Both companies became independent in 1911 when the U.S. Supreme Court dissolved the Standard Oil combine, but the two merged in 1931 to form Socony-Vacuum Corporation. The name was changed in 1934 to Socony-Vacuum Oil Company, Inc., in 1955 to Socony Mobil Oil Company, Inc., and then in 1966 to Mobil Oil Corporation.In an effort to diversify beyond its oil holdings, Mobil in 1974 acquired 54 percent of the voting shares of Marcor Inc. (then the parent company ofContainer Corporation of AmericaandMontgomery Ward & Co.), and two years later Marcor merged into Mobil. Mobil sold the Container Corporation of America in 1986 and soldMontgomery Ward & Co.in 1988, thus clearing the way for Mobil to concentrate on its core businesses of petroleum extraction, processing, and distribution. After the merger 10 years later that createdExxon Mobil, all products bearing the Mobilbrand nameretained the company’s long-standing logo ofPegasus, the winged horse.\"],\n",

He is trained as a lawyer and an economist and his academic and professional experience spans the US, Europe and Brazil.

The Fubo Settlement, Disney, and the Death of the Venu Sports-Streaming VentureAccording to the British Competition and Markets Authority, barriers to entry are so high that not even Amazon is a real threat to Google and Facebook’s dominance. These practices allow digital platforms to raise prices, while advertisers pass the extra costs to their clients.Editor’s note:Following an extensive study, the UK’s Competition\\xa0and Markets Authority (CMA)\\xa0expressed concerns in December that Google and Facebook have grown so “large and have such extensive access to data that potential rivals can no longer compete on equal terms.”This is the fourth post in aserieson the status of competition in search, social media, and digital advertising markets. It explores the main preliminary findings of a largemarket studyconducted by the CMA, as well as a December 2019 antitrustcondemnation of Google in Francefor abusing its dominant position in the French market for digital ads. The rest of the series can be foundhere.Previous installments explored the CMA’s preliminary conclusions that the British markets for general search and social media are dominated by Google and Facebook, respectively. For the CMA, this dominance may harm users through reduced innovation, lower quality of services, excessive data collection, or higher prices for goods and services.Both general search and social media are two-sided markets,\\xa0where an intermediary connects two or more sides (e.g. Google connecting users and websites), such as when Apple connects app developers and iPhone users through its App Store. As such, proper analysis has to consider not only the potentially negative impacts on consumers but also the impact on publishers and advertisers. The\\xa0Competition\\xa0and Markets Authority’s study of the dynamics of digital ads, however, indicates that Google and Facebook also control digital advertising markets, where advertisers confront high prices, opacity, and many conflicts of interest.The first question the CMA faced was the extent to which digital advertising competes with legacy media such as TV, radio, or newspapers. The CMA concluded that digital advertising is a market in and of itself. Companies that rely on digital advertising cannot substitute it for traditional media because these legacy channels lack data and the ability to personalize ads and because most online advertisers are smaller companies that do not have the funds or scale required for most legacy ads.The CMA then divided online advertising markets into four non-substitutable segments: search, display advertising (advertisement on banners/videos associated with content), open display (third-party companies selling advertisement inventory on their websites, e.g. newspapers), and classified ads. It analyzed the first three, which correspond to the vast majority of expenditures in the UK.Search AdvertisementFor the CMA, the body of evidence it analyzed “suggests that Google has substantial market power in search advertising,” the market for ads that search engines display on the top of a search result.Google controls 94 percent of the market for search ads in the UK. Its control over the search advertising market is higher than its control over the search market (where it holds a 90 percent share) because Google charges more per ad than competitors and is more effective at monetizing its platform—as shown by the data gathered by the CMA on the total number of monetized clicks in the UK:Google argued that it faces strong competition from vertical search engines (such as Booking.com or Expedia in travel) and from Amazon. After a careful analysis, the CMA concluded that neither threaten Google’s dominance.That is because vertical search engines actually rely on Google for traffic—for example, 50 percent of Booking.com’s operational expenses are with ads it buys from Google. The CMA also concluded that while Amazon might develop into a relevant competitor in the search advertising market, it is unlikely to pose a threat to Google in the near future. Not only is Amazon Google’s main client in terms of search revenue, demonstrating an important vertical link, but the CMA estimates that retail ads (where Amazon could grow) account for only 18 percent of Google’s revenues with ad search, or 33 percent if all the retail sector is considered.Even in a future worst-case scenario, Google would still dominate two-thirds of the market.For the CMA, Google’s dominant position in search advertising is protected by important barriers to entry and expansion of competitors. Initially, competitors face important barriers in developing the user side of search that provides parties with inventory to sell (explored in thesecond postof this series). Search advertising also has its own important barriers to entry and expansion.First, Google restricts interoperability in these markets. This increases transaction costs in search advertising and prevents smaller advertisers from multi-homing. Second, Google controls much essential proprietary data, in particular tags in third-party websites that allow it to track the success of search ads (whether it led to sales, etc.), key metrics for the market. For example, Google’s tags are present in 88 percent of third-party UK websites, versus 1 percent of Microsoft’s tags. Finally, Google’s vertical integration creates opacity, increases the cost of entry, and enables exploitative practices by Google against advertisers.For the CMA, such practices (which the agency intends to investigate further) may harm consumers through higher prices (as businesses pass-through search costs), diminishing innovation, the charging of hidden fees, and by enabling Google to leverage its dominance in search to other markets. The CMA stressed how Google’s high margins of 44 percent, versus a cost of capital of 9 percent, would be indicative of economic exploitation in this market.Display AdvertisingThe CMA equally concluded that\\xa0Facebook has market power in display advertising, the market for\\xa0ads such as videos, banners, or sponsored pages that are displayed in owned and operated platforms (e.g. Facebook, Snapchat, or YouTube ads).Facebook accounts for almost 50 percent of the display market and is at least four times larger than Google/YouTube, the second major player. If the market is divided in video and non-video ads, something the CMA defends, Facebook’s share grows to almost 60 percent.The CMA concluded that Twitter, Snapchat, and other, smaller social media networks do not materially restrict Facebook’s market power as these companies lack scale, sophistication, and supply capacity to challenge Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Google. This highly complex and opaque market is also open to many types of abuses, such as Facebookinflating its statisticson video viewership in the platform (advertisers must rely on Facebook’s own reporting of viewership as the company restricts third-party auditing of the platform). The CMA stresses that it received many complaints reporting fraud in digital advertising metrics and that it will investigate further.While the agency stressed how fraud levels appear to be low and decreasing, it does not believe that reputational concerns alone will solve the opacity and conflicts of interest associated with the fact that the companies that sell ads are also those that report on viewership/effectiveness—largely because Facebook and Google purposefully designed these markets to be opaque and dependent on them.The CMA stressed how Facebook’s privileged position in display advertising is protected by four important barriers to entry. First, the need for scale in the development of platforms, sales teams, bidding technologies, and others. Second, network effects that attract eyeballs in social media markets and generate sales inventory (explored in thethird post). Third, Facebook’s control over user data allows it to better personalize ads, increase the reach of campaigns, and prevent other companies from offering competing ads metrics services. Finally, Facebook’s incumbent position in social media allows it to manipulate the market and prevent competitors from reaching enough scale to tackle its dominant position.For the CMA, Facebook’s dominance can negatively impact consumers through a variety of channels. These include higher consumer prices as advertisers pass through increased ad costs in Facebook’s platforms; excessive collection of user data—indeed, the CMA stressed that Facebook has a complex privacy interface and does not allow users to restrict data collection or turn off ad personalization; and increased ad costs as Facebook manipulates the supply of display advertising on its platform.For the CMA, Facebook’s high margins, estimated at 51 percent versus a cost of capital of 9 percent, would be indicative of economic exploitation in this market.Open Display AdvertisingFinally, the CMA also concluded that Google has a strong position in all segments of the open display market: ads such as videos and banners displayed in smaller scale publisher webpages (e.g. the banners or pop-up ads displayed when you access a blog or a newspaper website).This market is different from display advertising because rather than simply hiring Facebook/Snapchat to do the ad placement, smaller publishers must rely on a complex system of intermediaries that connects them to advertisers (see below).According to the CMA,\\xa0Google controls 90 percent of the ad server market, leveraging this power to other segments of the market such as demand-side platforms (where it holds a 50-70 percent share) and supply-side platforms (40-60 percent share).For the CMA, Google’s dominant position is protected by relevant barriers to entry and expansion. First, Google controls a unique database of personal data that is all but required to match advertisers and publishers in this market. Second, Google’s unique third-party tags (described above) allow it to better track users and report ads metrics without competition. Third, its 90 percent control over the publisher ad service market is protected by high switching costs, as the process of integrating a publisher’s website to an ad server is costly, complex, and may lead to much foregone revenue, forcing publishers to rely on a single supplier. Finally, Google’s vertical integration not only increases the cost of entry but also allows it to leverage its dominance over a key input to other segments, increasing its control over the whole market.Google’s opaque business also created many conflicts of interest and opened market players to all sorts of obscure charges and arbitrariness. Open display is probably the most complex and opaque market in all digital advertising, as it is highly automatized and involves a number of intermediaries between the advertiser and the publisher. For the CMA, advertisers and publishers face a lack of transparency over key aspects of the market, including measurements of effectiveness, quality, how prices are determined, and how much intermediaries are paid—by some estimates, Google and other intermediaries retain as much as 60 percent of advertising expenditures.All in all, the CMA expressed concerns that these problems are also leading to higher prices and lower quality, which are then passed on to consumers. The agency is\\xa0further investigating many of Google’s leveraging practices. In particular, the CMA stressed how open display markets are essential for the funding of startups and the survival of newspapers, so abuses in market power may have particularly pernicious effects on society.The image below summarizes the CMA’s findings regarding the main forms of consumer harm that may arise as a result of Google’s and Facebook’s dominance of online markets based on advertising:Filippo Maria Lancieri is a fellow at the Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State.

       "   'Date28 September 2021TopicsCompetition and exemptionsAdvertising and promotionsDigital platforms and servicesAn ACCC inquiry into the advertising technology (or ‘ad tech’) sector has identified significant competition concerns and likely harms to publishers, advertisers and, ultimately, consumers.Thereport, published today, concludes that enforcement action under Australia’s existing competition laws alone is not sufficient to address the competition issues in the sector, and that the ACCC should be given powers to develop specific rules in response.Ad tech services facilitate complex transactions for the selling and buying of advertising space on websites or apps, resulting in the ads that are displayed to consumers.The report finds that Google has a dominant position in key parts of the ad tech supply chain and estimates that more than 90 per cent of ad impressions traded via the ad tech supply chain passed through at least one Google service in 2020.Google’s dominance in the ad tech supply chain is underpinned by multiple factors including its access to consumer and other data, access to exclusive inventory and integration across its ad tech services. Key acquisitions by Google, including of DoubleClick in 2007, AdMob in 2009, as well as YouTube in 2006 have helped Google entrench its position in ad tech.The report finds that Google has used its position to preference its own services and shield them from competition. For example, Google prevents rival ad tech services from accessing ads on YouTube, providing its own ad tech services with an important advantage.Google has also refused to participate in publisher-led header bidding, an industry innovation aimed at increasing competition for publishers’ inventory, and previously allowed its services to have a ‘last look’ opportunity to outbid rivals.“Google has used its vertically integrated position to operate its ad tech services in a way that has, over time, led to a less competitive ad tech industry. This conduct has helped Google to establish and entrench its dominant position in the ad tech supply chain,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.“Google’s activities across the supply chain also mean that, in a single transaction, Google can act on behalf of both the advertiser (the buyer) and the publisher (the seller) and operate the ad exchange connecting these two parties. As the interests of these parties do not align, this creates conflicts of interest for Google which can harm both advertisers and publishers.”Ad tech services perform an important role in the digital economy, helping Australian businesses reach consumers and publishers fund online content.The report estimates that, in Australia, at least 27 per cent of advertiser spend on ads sold via the ad tech supply chain was retained by ad tech providers in 2020.“We are concerned that the lack of competition has likely led to higher ad tech fees. An inefficient ad tech industry means higher costs for both publishers and advertisers, which is likely to reduce the quality or quantity of online content and ultimately results in consumers paying more for advertised goods”, Mr Sims said.“The ACCC is considering specific allegations against Google under existing competition laws. However new regulatory solutions are needed to address Google’s dominance and to restore competition to the ad tech sector for the benefit of businesses and consumers. We recommend rules be considered to manage conflicts of interest, prevent anti-competitive self-preferencing, and ensure rival ad tech providers can compete on their merits.”“We have identified systemic competition concerns relating to conduct over many years and multiple ad tech services, including conduct that harms rivals. Investigation and enforcement proceedings under general competition laws are not well suited to deal with these sorts of broad concerns, and can take too long if anti-competitive harm is to be prevented,” Mr Sims said.“Many of the concerns we identified in the ad tech supply chain are similar to concerns in other digital platform markets, such as online search, social media and app marketplaces. These markets are also dominated by one or two key providers, which benefit from vertical integration, leading to significant competition concerns. In many cases these are compounded by a lack of transparency.”Sector-specific regulation, such as that proposed in this report, is not new. Other industries, such as telecommunications, have specific rules which can address particular competition and transparency concerns identified in those sectors.“How the recommendations in this Report should be given effect, including the legal framework for the proposed rules and powers will be considered as part of a broader ACCC report due in September 2022,” Mr Sims said.That report will also look at whether the proposed rules for ad tech need to form part of a broader regulatory scheme to address common competition and consumer concerns we have identified in digital platform markets. Consultation on that report will commence in the first quarter of 2022 and will take into account overseas legislative proposals to deal with these issues.“We are also engaging very closely with our international counterparts who are at different stages of introducing similar rules to deal with these issues,” Mr Sims said.Google’s access to data has contributed to its dominance in ad techGoogle has access to a large volume and range of first-party data gathered through its customer-facing services, such as Search, Maps and YouTube. The extent to which Google uses its first-party data to advantage its ad tech businesses is not clear and is a source of confusion among industry stakeholders.“We recommend that Google makes clear how it uses its data through clear public statements in its terms and conditions and other material it uses to sell its services,” Mr Sims said.The report also recommends that under the proposed new sector-specific rules, the ACCC be given the power to develop and implement special measures to address competition issues caused by an ad tech provider’s data advantage, such as data separation or data access requirements to address the competition risks that may arise from the use of first party data.Need for greater transparency of the ad tech supply chainThe ACCC also found that the pricing and the operation of ad tech services lack transparency. The complexity of the supply chain contributes to this lack of transparency and can make it difficult for advertisers and publishers to understand how the supply chain is operating and detect misconduct.It recommends the industry establish standards, requiring ad tech providers to publish average fees and take rates to enable ad tech customer to easily compare fees and take rates across different ad tech providers and services. It also recommends an industry standard to enable full and independent verification of the services advertisers use in the supply chain.The report also identified specific transparency issues with Google’s publisher services, and recommends that Google should be required to provide publishers with information about the operation and outcomes of its publisher ad server auctions.“If Google fails to provide sufficient information, or the industry’s voluntary standards do not achieve transparency, then new requirements should be able to be put in place to address this,” Mr Sims said.Notes to editorsAd tech services are used in the buying and selling of digital display advertising through open display channels. They involve the automated use of complex algorithms and systems to trade digital ads on websites and apps in a matter of milliseconds.Digital display advertisements include the images or videos that appear before or alongside content viewed online. This inquiry considers the ad tech services that deliver digital display advertising to consumers, and associated advertising agency services.Display ads can appear as banners, pop-ups and videos. They can be traded through open display channels (which relies on ad tech to facilitate the buying and selling of ads) or via closed (or owned and operated channels), such as when publishers sell ads directly to advertisers using their own systems. Open display channels are the focus of this report.Size of digital advertising channels in AustraliaSource: ACCC analysis of data obtained from ad tech providers and provided by IAB AustraliaExamples of situations where individuals may view targeted display advertising include:Image or video ads shown while viewing a website in a browser on a desktop or mobile device;Image or video advertising integrated into the content of a mobile app;Videos shown during the ‘ad breaks’ in the ‘catch-up’ video streaming services of major commercial television networks.Generally, when a consumer visits a publisher’s website or app, its publisher side services send out a request to many advertisers through their advertiser-side services, asking for bids from advertisers who would like to show an ad to the consumer. The advertiser-side services and publisher-side services then run a series of automated processes, including auctions, to select a winning ad which is then sent to the publisher.The inquiry has examined four key ad tech services: advertiser ad servers, demand-side platforms, supply-side platforms and publisher ad servers.BackgroundOn 10 February 2020, the Treasurer signed a Ministerial Direction requiring the ACCC to hold a public inquiry into markets for the supply of ad tech services and ad agency services.The inquiry started in March 2020 with therelease of an issues paper, and aninterim reportwas released in January 2021.The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Branch is also conducting a separatefive-year inquiryinto markets for the supply of digital platform services. Under that inquiry, reports are provided to the Treasurer every six months.Release number149/21General enquiriesContact usto report an issue or make an enquiry.Media enquiriesMedia Team - 1300 138 917, media@accc.gov.au',\n",
       "   'AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENTSAN FRANCISCO — Type “buttermilk pancakes” into Google, and among the top three or four search results you will find a link to a detailed recipe complete with a photo of a scrumptious stack from a site called Knol, which is owned by Google.Google envisions Knol as a place where experts can share their knowledge on a variety of topics. It hopes to create a sort of online encyclopedia built from the contributions of scores of individuals. But while Wikipedia is collectively edited and ad-free, Knol contributors sign their articles and retain editing control over the content. They can choose to place ads, sold by Google, on their pages.While Knol is only three weeks old and still relatively obscure, it has already rekindled fears among some media companies that Google is increasingly becoming a competitor. They foresee Google’s becoming a powerful rival that not only owns a growing number of content properties, including YouTube, the top online video site, and Blogger, a leading blogging service, but also holds the keys to directing users around the Web.“If in fact a Google property is taking money away from Google’s partners, that is a real problem,” said Wenda Harris Millard, the co-chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.Money, of course, is very much at issue. The lower a site ranks in search results, the less traffic it receives from search engines. With a smaller audience, the site earns less money from advertising.Although Martha Stewart’s buttermilk pancake recipe appears lower than the Knol recipe in Google’s rankings, Ms. Millard does not believe that Google unfairly favors pages from Knol. But she said that Google’s dual role as search engine and content site raises an issue of perception. “The question in people’s minds is how unbiased can Google be as it grows and grows and grows,” Ms. Millard said.Google has always said it will never compromise the objectivity of its search results. And it says it treats Knol pages like any other pages on the Web. “When you see Knol pages rank high, they are there because they have earned their position,” said Gabriel Stricker, a spokesman for Google.There is little evidence that Knol has received favorable treatment. Many of the Knol pages that rank high on Google rank similarly high on Yahoo. (The Knol buttermilk pancakes? No. 4 with Yahoo search.)Google has long insisted that it has no plans to own or create content, and that it is a friend, not a foe, of media companies. The Google search engine sends huge numbers of users to the digital doorsteps of thousands of media companies, many of which also rely on Google to place ads on their sites. “Our vision still remains to be the best conduit that we can be, connecting people between whatever their search is and the answer they are looking for,” Mr. Stricker said. “For that reason, we are not interested in owning or creating content.”Knol is merely a tool for others to create and publish information, and once they do, Mr. Stricker said, “our job, which is to organize that information, kicks in.” Google does not own copyrights to the Knol content, and the site will not carry the Google logo, he added.Knol is not Google’s first foray into content hosting. The company has long owned Blogger, one of the most popular blogging services. It is digitizing millions of books, which it makes available through its search service. It owns the archives of Usenet, a popular collection of online discussion forums that predates the Web. Google also carries some news stories from The Associated Press in Google News, and it publishes stock market information through Google Finance. And of course, Google owns YouTube, one of the largest media sites on the Web.Critics say each new Google initiative in this area casts more doubt on the company’s claims that it is not a media company.ImageCredit...Illustration by The New York Times“Google can say they are not in the content business, but if they are paying people and distributing and archiving their work, it is getting harder to make that case,” said Jason Calacanis, the chief executive of Mahalo, a search engine that relies on editors to create pages on a variety of subjects. “They are competing for talent, for advertisers and for users” with content sites, he said.Knol has been called a potential rival to Wikipedia and other sites whose content spans a broad range of topics, including Mahalo and About.com, a property of The New York Times Company that uses experts it calls “guides” to write articles on a variety of topics.Asked whether Knol posed a threat to About.com, Martin A. Nisenholtz, senior vice president of digital operations at the Times Company, said, “About.com is very well positioned in the marketplace.” Knol could also compete with many Web sites that specialize in single topics, like WebMD in medical information or the smattering of how-to, do-it-yourself or cooking information sites and other instructional sites that are proliferating online.Some online media companies say they are unconcerned about the prospect of competing with Knol.“Assuming that Google treats Knol just like it treats other Web sites, it is just another company out there producing content,” said Richard Rosenblatt, the chief executive of Demand Media, a fast-growing online company that owns how-to content sites like eHow and ExpertVillage.Mr. Rosenblatt, who was the chief executive of Intermix Media, the parent of MySpace when it was sold to the News Corporation, said that if Knol became a popular Web destination, he would consider posting content from Demand Media’s sites on it. The company, like many others in the media business, posts many of its videos on YouTube.“We have an enormous amount of traffic on YouTube,” Mr. Rosenblatt said. “It hasn’t cannibalized ExpertVillage.”Other media companies, like WebMD, have already begun posting their content on Knol.“We participated in Google Knol as a test, as we’ve done with other, similar offerings,” a WebMD spokeswoman, Jennifer Newman, said in an e-mail message. “We are evaluating its effectiveness in further building brand awareness for WebMD.”Ms. Millard, the Martha Stewart executive, said she had considered posting content on Knol but decided against it. “You are continuing to build their business if you do that, versus building your own.”Google’s growing reach into the content business could create conflicts similar to those faced by Microsoft in its dual role as a provider of an operating system that others run their software applications on and a maker of applications, Mr. Calacanis said. It is possible that with YouTube, Knol, Blogger and other company sites, Google could take 3 of the top 10 results in some searches, he added. That could alienate Web publishers that are Google’s advertising partners, even if there is no indication that Google artificially favored its sites, he said.While Google helps drive the success of other content providers, it is clear that the company will not shy away from entering what it considers “high-value” content areas, said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.“If I am a content provider and I depend upon Google as a mechanism to drive traffic to me, should I fear that they may compete with me in the future?” Professor Yoffie asked. “The answer is absolutely, positively yes.”Google has appeared even-handed with search queries, Professor Yoffie said. But he, too, believes that if Google further expands into content, it will meet some of the conflicts Microsoft faced more than a decade ago.“A lot of the issues that we saw play out between Microsoft and its ecosystem in the 1990s will play out again between Google and its ecosystem,” he said.A version of this article appears in print on, SectionC, Page1of the New York editionwith the headline:Is Google a Media Company?.Order Reprints|Today’s Paper|SubscribeSee more on:Alphabet Inc.0Share full article0AdvertisementSKIP ADVERTISEMENT',\n",
       "   'De-classified: What really happened to newspapersSep 04, 2020·[[read-time]] min readShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInMailCopy linkNic HopkinsHead of News Partnerships, Australia & New ZealandShareTwitterFacebookLinkedInMailCopy linkIn the mid-1990s the status of newspapers as the main source of news to society felt both indisputable and permanent.The Internet was a novelty. We accessed the web on dial-up modems, surfed pages using Netscape and searched for information on Yahoo!, Excite and Lycos. Around the same time, across the Pacific, Amazon had only just launched an obscure online bookstore.In 1995, I began my career as a journalist atThe Advertiserin Adelaide. The web was so niche that there were fevered debates about whether we would need one “Internet terminal,” or perhaps two, for an entire newsroom.Newspapers back then could afford to take their time with technology–there was no rush. They were unassailable and spectacularly profitable, thanks largely to classified advertising. Rupert Murdoch oncedescribedclassifieds as “rivers of gold”.Today, as we all know, the landscape is vastly different. The print rivers of goldhave dried up, print circulation has sharply declined. On the face of it, the news business has never looked so vulnerable. To me, and anyone else who has worked in print or simply loves newspapers, this has been a painful process. My dad worked in newspapers–it’s in our blood.Source: AlphaBetaWhat happened?Ananalysis of the revenues of newspapersover nearly two decades, recently conducted for Google by the economists atAlphaBeta, is revealing–there is no mistaking precisely how and over what time period the old business model for newspapers broke.In 2002, Australian newspapers collected 96% of all classified advertising, which amounted to $1.6 billion. By 2018, the total classified advertising market had grown to $1.9 billion, but only 12% of that was going to newspapers–the rest has splintered off to specialist online providers such as Domain, Realestate.com.au, Carsales and Seek.Over that same period we moved from sitting at bulky desktop computers with slow connections to carrying a supercomputer in smartphone form, with instant access to news and information. Australian newspaper revenues peaked at $5.5 billion in 2007-08, just asApple introduced the iPhone. The smartphone in our pocket, able to access the content news publishers made available for free on their websites, was almost a perfect disincentive to buying the next day’s newspaper. We now consume more news, but fewer newspapers.That’s not all that has changed, of course. Over the same period we’ve seen the transformative development of search and social media platforms. Google launched ads in 2003, and it has grown to become a global business as the web itself has expanded to hundreds of billions of pages. Facebook was founded in 2004, and today almost 3 billion people use it to connect with each other around the world. Together they earn billions of dollars in revenue from commercial advertisers in Australia.A widely held view is that if Google and Facebook didn’t exist, much of this revenue would have stayed with news publishers–that these tech platforms directly disrupted the newspaper business model. ButAlphaBeta’s researchdisproves that theory: it wasn’t Google or Facebook specifically, it was technology in its entirety.Search advertising is an entirely new category which allows businesses that would never have taken out a newspaper ad to reach specific audiences right at the instant they are seeking a product or service. And they only pay if a user actually clicks on their ad. Locally, Google’s advertising customers in Australia include a multitude of small and medium-sized businesses that never would have generated a substantial proportion of a newspaper’s income. If there is an incumbent publisher that has been disrupted by search ads, it’s directory operators like the Yellow Pages.The total Australian advertising market almost doubled between 2002 and 2018 from $8.9 billion to $16.6 billion, and almost all of that growth came from search and social. But to suggest that that money would otherwise have gone to news publishers would require news publishers to have built their own search engines and social platforms. They didn’t.Every time you use Gumtree to sell a bike, browse Domain for a place to live or flick through Carsales represents the flow of money away from newspapers. Major publishers still own large stakes in these digital classifieds businesses but the revenues no longer fund journalism.However, theAlphaBeta studyalso offers hope. The business model that was broken is being re-made through technology: distribution, analytics, advertising, subscriptions. Reader contributions and subscriptions are transforming the economics of publishing news.Today we spend greater amounts of time than ever before consuming the news, and there are many innovative new publishers finding readers that would have struggled to get a foothold in the days of the printing press. There are even green shoots of growth amid the COVID destruction - Telum Mediareportedthis week that more than 30 new digital mastheads have emerged just this year.In the quarter of a century since I first began as a fledgling print journalist the news industry has been radically, often painfully, transformed. It has taken years of trial and error, but there are paths that now lead to publishing profits and prosperity.It’s my hope that Google can continue to support the news industry, through new products which pay publishers for high-quality content, and continuethe workwe have been doing for almost two decades in helping newsrooms to find new audiences, engage them with compelling stories and generate new income through digital channels.POSTED IN:',\n",
       "   'I used to get endless grief from pro-regulatory media activists here in DC when I put forward the argument in days past that Google was a media company and a major player in the battle for eyes, ears and ad dollars in America’s media marketplace. Increasingly, however, more people are coming around to seeing that point, even the crusty old media giants themselves.In a smart essayover at the Freedom to Tinker blog, David Robinson takes the New York Times to task for an article today again wondering, “Is Google a Media Company?”  As David rightly argues:I hope the Times’s internal business staff is better grounded than its reporters and editors appear to be—otherwise, the Times is in even deeper trouble than its flagging performance suggests. Google isn’t becoming a media company — it is one now and always has been. From the beginning, it has sold the same thing that the Times and other media outlets do: Audiences. Unlike the traditional media outlets, though, online media firms like Google and Yahoo have decoupled content production from audience sales. Whether selling ads alongside search results, or alongside user-generated content on Knol or YouTube, or displaying ads on a third party blog or even a traditional media web site, Google acts as a broker, selling audiences that others have worked to attract. In so doing, they’ve thrown the competition for ad dollars wide open, allowing any blog to sap revenue (proportionately to audience share) from the big guys. The whole infrastructure is self-service and scales down to be economical for any publisher, no matter how small. It’s a far cry from an advertising marketplace that relies, as the newspaper business traditionally has, on human add sales. In the new environment, it’s a buyer’s market for audiences, and nobody is likely to make the kinds of killings that newspapers once did. As I’ve argued before, the worrying and plausible future for high-cost outlets like the Times is a death of a thousand cuts as revenues get fractured among content sources.Exactly right. I’ve made a similar argument in Chapter 2 of my big “Media Metrics” report.SHARE:14comments',\n",

       "   'Back to all articlesBeyond Google: The future of search marketingKelsey AndersonSr. Content Marketing ManagerLength12 min readDate20 April 2023The globalsearch advertisingmarket is growing and poised for continued expansion in the coming years.$279Projected search advertising spend in 2023 (billions)9%Annual growth rate of the ad spending market$390Projected volume of ad spending market by 2027\\xa0(billions)For the longest time, Google Search was the main gateway to the web. But times are changing.Google still has an effective monopoly on search with amarket share of 91.75%. But today’s web is far larger and more complex than in the early days of the internet. Unbundling will not pose an existential threat to Google search, but it will divide Google’s hold on the information market to a degree.At DEPT®, we believe that the “post-search” future is fueled by chatbots, generative content, marketplaces, and a rising generation’s unique approach to how they discover, search, and find information.In this playbook, we reveal three game-changing trends shaping search beyond the traditional search engine. As a marketer or brand, it’s crucial to stay ahead of the curve and adapt to these shifts to grow and maintain a successful online presence moving forward.Let’s dive in.01—AI is poweringnext-generation searchMicrosoft Bing, Google Bard, and ChatGPT are ushering in a new era of “conversational” search.Forget typing in keywords and receiving hundreds of links as a result. Search is evolving into a “natural” conversation between Chatbot and user. AI models like ChatGPT perform various natural language processing tasks, including text classification, question answering, and machine translation.A conversation-based interface would radically shift users from keyword-based systems like Google. So, what would it mean to replace the click economy and the search bar, with something like a conversation?It took only a few weeks for Microsoft Bing’s search engine to reach 100 million users. Compare that to other technologies:Source: Digital Information WorldFor years, human beings have been playing a game with rules set by machines. We try to gain insight into what signals search engines value. Then, we attempt to meet those standards so our content and websites rank favorably. There’s no doubt that plenty of talented SEO professionals play this game at an expert level, creating immense value for their companies. But, there are a lot of ways in which machines can play this game better than people.Artificial intelligence is being used to help individual companies do SEO better and faster because it can analyze patterns in data faster than humans, at scale, and in real time.AI-powered SEO tools are being deployed today by search pros to do more with less and gain competitive advantages that manual work alone just can’t match. That includes using AI to optimize existing content, suggest new topics to target, and even automate existing SEO tasks.Thanks to this power to augment and improve AI marketing use cases like SEO, McKinsey analysts writing inHarvard Business Reviewestimate that AI can create $1.4 to $2.6 trillion of value in marketing and sales alone.There’s no question… Used correctly, AI can give you SEO superpowers. Here’s how.More effectiveness, efficiency, and speedUsing AI for your SEO strategy can help you become quicker, more efficient, and more productive when it comes to managing your digital marketing.Think about it: AI is highly automated, which means that lengthy, time-consuming tasks are now eliminated. And because you don’t need to hire developers to code software, you can be more strategic in the planning and delivery of your digital content creation. The bottom line? Massive time and money savings. The information that you can dig out with AI for SEO is also incredibly accurate and up-to-date, which in turn helps boost productivity and inform meaningful business decisions.Improved user experience and customer satisfactionThe very aim of all AI tools is to provide a user experience that is as relevant, useful, and personalized as possible. In a nutshell: AI is there to make your life (and your users’ lives) better. And what happens if you manage to make your clients’ lives better by providing hyper-personalized services and products? They will come back for more and spread the word about how great your brand is.Higher rankingsLast but not least: with an AI-powered SEO strategy, you can aim for the stars. Meaning you can reach higher SERP rankings today and in the future. One of the reasons is that AI helps to craft a bespoke, stellar user experience.\\xa0 And user experience is one of the main criteria that impact your SERP ranking. In addition, AI for SEO will help you to lift your rankings because it enables you to discover and use exactly the right keywords, topics, and content that your audience is searching for.Today, any SEO expert can leverage AI and ChatGPT to help them with text compilation, summarization, questions and answers, chat, and translations.So will ChatGPT finally spell the end of search engines? Doubtful.While it will probably siphon off some usage from search engines, it’s difficult to imagine a wholesale change in global user behavior that completely upends Google in the short term.While SEOs are well-accustomed to grappling with their mortality, the past year is the first time that think-pieces threatened Google’s existence. First withGen Z’s extensive use of TikTokand now with theAI chatbots. It’s not to say that empires don’t fall, nor that they can’t collapse quickly. Any good financial advisor would caution that past performance isn’t indicative of future results, but even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in thisarticle with The Verge,“I think whenever someone talks about technology being the end of some other giant company, it’s usually wrong. I think people forget they get to make a countermove here, and they’re like pretty smart, pretty competent. I do think there’s a change for search that will probably come at some point – but not as dramatically as people think in the short term.”02— Social media isGenZ’s search engineof choiceSocial media is the new search engine for younger generationsIn a study run by Google in 2022, they found that almost 40% of young people, when looking for a place for lunch, don’t go to Google Maps or Search. They go to TikTok or Instagram.Nowadays, links as search results are not enough. Consumers are generally more interested in visually rich forms of search and discovery, as well as reviews from people they can trust.Source: GWI, Business wireTraditional advertising is losing the brand discovery throne to social mediaTikTok recently released Search ads, but it’s not something new to social media. Pinterest has had the option to target ads based on keywords for ages, and the same for Twitter.But the fact that TikTok now also focuses on this means that they also acknowledge that more people are using social media to search for topics rather than getting served random content in their feed.It has never been more important to have your organic and paid media working together across social platforms.Social media is moving from a connection-led approach to a discovery-led approach.That means content is served based on what people watch and engage with rather than who they’re following on the platform. Content is more relevant to who they are and what they want to see, ultimately giving brands quicker access to the people that want to buy from them.This coupled with how digestible content is in places like TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts means that it is only natural that they go there to search for what they want to know more about. Of course, that also means they consume the content and buy from the brands that help them do that.It is critically important that the content you develop for organic and paid channels addssomething tothe lives of your audience.How to leverage social media for search and discoveryBe a first moverBeing a first mover can be powerful for brands, so sign up where applicable. You’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain.Stay up to date with social platform’s latest ad offerings and lean into changes. For example, TikTok has released TikTok Search Ads for advertisers to tap into. The platform is planning to lean into the search space as a priority this year, with plans to launch its own search ads platform. Instagram is also capitalizing on search functionality with the announcement of ads in search results.Prioritize discoverabilityStart paying attention to visual search, it’s how most of today’s discovery organically happens.Experiment with producing engaging content that shows up in discovery spaces like Reels, TikTok, or query-based videos. Use captions, hashtags, and text in your videos to rank higher in search. Once this baseline is set up, connect your physical showroom to your socials with live video and product feeds to reflect your physical store experience. This will create the full funnel of discovery>>purchase on a single platform.Treat TikTok like your shop windowSocial media is the new SEO, so take your social media pages and profiles seriously.Get your shops set up by uploading your product catalogs to social media platforms. Traditionally people went online to find products, but now products find us. Look after your advocates and make the most of user-generated content. Your existing fans are an asset if you reward them for loyalty. Harness this by encouraging your followers and customers to create and share videos.03—Retail media networks are thefuture of product discoveryRetail browsing was historically conducted in store or in printThe internet changed this, bringing first the browsing capability to an online format. Over time, grew accustomed to shopping online and have also started using mobile devices to browse and purchase products. E-commerce has significantly impacted the way we search for products, with retailers having played a vital role in shaping this change.The 90sRetail browsing happens predominantly in-store. The first online marketplace launches. Amazon and eBay launch.The 00sOnline browsing picks up as digital storefronts become a retail norm. This is encouraged with the launch of Shopify in 2006.The 10sShopping moves to mobile, and e-commerce escalates quickly. Amazon launches ads and the first retail media network in 2012.The 20sMost people begin their product searches on online marketplaces. Retail media networks like Walmart, ebay, Alibaba and Target are quickly on the rise.Amazon has surpassed Google for product searches on the internetIn fact, many people now begin their product searches on Amazon, giving the e-commerce giant a consistent audience for its search function and opening up opportunities to refine the customer experience.Amazon and other retailers’ search tools need only index the products sold on their sites. They don’t have to answer complex questions, scouring the entirety of the internet in the process (like Google). They live by more basic principles, focused on relevancy and sales velocity.Retail media is the second fastest-growing sector of digital marketingAside from connected TV, retail media is the fastest-growing sector of digital marketing, with projections of 100B dollars in ad spend in the next few years.While Amazon comprises the majority of the space in the US, others are growing rapidly as well. Retailers such as Walmart and Kroger are now looking to replicate Amazon’s success. As retailers’ share of ad spending increases, expect to see other retail media marketplaces invest in their capabilities as well.Retail media is a game-changing approach that combines customer behavior data and high-quality inventory to help brands reach potential customers throughout their entire buying journey, from the first interaction to loyalty.By representing your brand at the point of sale, you can optimize each part of your campaigns and drive conversions without the need to build your own infrastructure. This approach allows you to leverage the extensive reach of marketplaces to drive sales, improve brand awareness, and increase ROI.How you can leverage retail media for your brandProduct visibility optimization leads to an increase in brand awarenessProduct visibility on marketplaces is a key step in the customer journey. Take advantage of a new platform to increase brand awareness and build brand loyalty. For quick wins, optimize your product titles, descriptions, and images to ensure they appear in relevant search results. Use search term reports to identify high-performing keywords and adjust bids and budgets.Use sponsored and display ads to showcase your brand values, unique selling points, and customer reviews. Use search advertising to target customers searching for products similar to yours and increase your brand exposure to a wider audience.Leverage each platform’s data sets for personalized customer experiencesRetail media marketplaces offer various engagement tools, allowing you to interact with customers and create a personalized shopping experience. Gain access to real-time performance data and optimize your campaigns for better results. Use targeting options that allow you to reach specific audiences based on demographics, interests, and behaviors.Focus on quality content to optimize performanceCreate eye-catching ads to stand out from the crowd and highlight your product. This includes video ads to showcase products, customer testimonials, and your brand story. Interactive content, like 360-degree product images or tours, show products in unique and creative ways.Limitless growth in search requires a combination of people and technology to succeed.To prepare yourself for next week and next year, you need to understand the future of search marketing. Traditional search engines will continue to have their place, but chatbots, generative content, marketplaces, and social media platforms are continuously evolving. Wherever users go to search for information, products, and local services is where you need to be.Need help in search marketing?

When we have confirmed access, the full article content will load.SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 15 - Google is poised to enter the highly competitive classified advertisement business, posing a threat to online and traditional businesses in that field.On Tuesday evening, Google, the dominant Web search site, was planning to introduce a service called Base, which it said was intended to permit Internet users to upload files and other information to Google's servers and make them searchable by category.Currently Google displays the results of queries as a simple list, ranked by relevance. Google Base would allow searchers to pull up information organized by any subject. Google, however, has not said how it will display information organized into groupings, like homes, cars or jobs. Initially, the service will be free.During an interview at Google headquarters last week, Salar Kamangar, Google's vice president for product management, said the new service was experimental and cautioned against viewing it as a imminent assault on the classified advertising business because it could be used in far broader ways.Still, several industry executives and analysts said they believed that Google Base was an aggressive first step in a series of maneuvers that would position the company as a powerful player in the $100 billion annual market for classified advertising.The general industry perception is that Google could potentially transform that market, which has already been shaken by the rapid shift to online searching and the free listing services offered by Craigslist.We are having trouble retrieving the article content.Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The pharmaceutical industry continues to generate stellar growth and wasestimated to be worth an impressive US$1.6 trillionin 2023. Despite disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic in recent years and rising research and development costs globally, pharmaceutical companies have remained agile. New medications are constantly being developed, approved and marketed, powering market growth. In 2023,55 new molecular entities were approvedby the FDA, the second-highest count in the past 30 years. This cohort was nearly double what it was in 2022, which is likely to be because of issues such as workflow disruptions and bandwidth problems caused by the global Covid-19 pandemic have improved. Several drug patents expired in 2023, including AbbVie’s Humira and Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara. Looking ahead to 2024 and beyond,the pharma industry is set to face further shake-ups in the coming yearswith many more blockbuster drugs from Bristol Myers Squibb, Novartis and other companies are set to face their first generic or biosimilar competitors in the largest global pharma market, the US. As always, the patent expirations should create quite a disturbance for many of the top players. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are also gradually changing the marketplace and some of the largest drugmakers have been strengthened through joining forces with or being bought out by other businesses. According to GlobalData’s Deals Database, in the global pharmaceutical industry, there were430 M&A deals announced at the start of 2024worth a total value of $68.8bn. There are not expected to be any megadeals that combine large conglomerates this year, but large pharma companies will likely continue to pursue with acquiring or partnering with biotechs to offset losses from patent expires. The below list of the top 10 biggest pharma companies in the world in 2024 is ranked by 2023 revenue for pharmaceutical sales only. GlaxoSmithKline, commonly known as GSK, remains in tenth place in 2024. Formed by the merger of Glaxo Wellcome plc and SmithKline Beecham plc in 2000, GSK specialises in the fields of pharmaceuticals, biologics, and vaccines. In July 2022, GSK completed the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business from the GSK Group to form the Haleon Group. They cut ties completely in early 2024, when they announced they had divested approximately 385 million ordinary shares in Haleon. Two years on, the demerger has already started to pay dividends, allowing GSK to focus purely on biopharmaceuticals, prioritising investment towards the development of innovative vaccines and medicines. In the full year 2023,GSK delivered a solid performance, with sales up by 6%, with the clear highlight being thelaunch of Arexvy. Tipped to be a blockbuster and approved by the FDA in 2023, Arexvy is the world’s first respiratory syncytial virus vaccine for older adults. Elsewhere the company continued to progress their pipeline and has at least 12 major launches planned before 2025, with new vaccines and speciality medicines for infectious diseases, HIV, respiratory and oncology. At the end of H1 2023,GSK completed the acquisition of Bellus Health, further adding to their portfolio, in February 2024 they announced they wereacquiring Aiolos Biobolstering their existing asthma business. With continued momentum, CEO, Emma Walmsley is confident in their ability to deliver meaningful growth in 2024 and announced their plans to upgrade their growth outlooks for 2026 and 2031. In ninth place in 2024 is global biopharma, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS). With a legacy in healthcare innovation dating back to the early 1800s, the company has made significant medical advances in oncology, hematology, immunology and cardiovascular disease. Full year 2023, BMS generated revenues of $45bn, a decrease of 3% compared to 2022, when sales reached US$46.2bn. A fall in income is largely owing to the loss of exclusivity for multiple myeloma treatment, Revlimid, but partially offset by higher sales for their new product portfolio and blockbuster advanced stage lung cancer treatment, Opdivo (+9%). In theearnings press release, CEO, Christopher Boerner commented “In 2024, our focus is on delivering strong commercial execution and accelerating opportunities that enhance our growth profile in the middle of the decade and beyond”. After being in the top 5 in 2023, in 2024 Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company, Novartis, comes in at number 8. For over a quarter of a millennium, Novartis has developed, manufactured and marketed breakthrough medicines. With the spin-off of Sandoz and the biosimilars division, the merger of their Oncology and Pharmaceuticals commercial organisations, for Novartis 2023 was about transforming into a “pure-play” innovative medicines business. The company reported that their net sales reached US$45.4 billion up 8% and 10% at constant currencies. Blood clot treatment, Eliquis, was the star of the show with worldwide sales increasing by 4%, driven by higher demand in the US. Opdivo (nivolumab), a prescription drug for advanced stage lung cancer, also drove a strong performance, helped by higher demand and new indications. In thefull year results press release, Novaritisconfirmed that they will continue to focus on four core therapeutic areas: cardiovascular-renal-metabolic, immunology, neuroscience and oncology. They have well developed pipelines in each area that will address disease burden and have high growth potential. Geographically, they plan to prioritise growth in the US, China, Germany and Japan. Headquartered in Cambridge, UK, AstraZeneca specialises in providing solutions for major disease areas, including oncology, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, infection, neuroscience, respiratory and inflammation. To strengthen their rare disease portfolio, AstraZeneca acquired American pharma, Alexion in 2021. Since then, AstraZeneca has demonstrated strong growth and for full year 2023, revenues rose by 3% driven by a solid performance for all key medicines and regions. In December 2023, AstraZeneca entered into an agreement to acquire Icosavax, Inc (Icosavax). The acquisition strengthens AstraZeneca’s late-stage pipeline. To further embellish their portfolio, at the end of 2023, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Gracell Biotechnologies Inc, a global clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for cancer and autoimmune diseases, enriching the company’s growing pipeline of cell therapies. In light of thefull year results, Pascal Soriot, CEO for AstraZeneca said, “As AstraZeneca celebrates its 25th anniversary, we are pleased to report another year of strong financial performance and scientific progress, with double-digit earnings growth, and investment in exciting areas of science, including antibody drug conjugates and cell therapies, that lay the foundations for long-term success.  We expect another year of strong growth in 2024, driven by continued adoption of our medicines across geographies. Our differentiated and growing portfolio of approved medicines, global reach and rich R&D pipeline give us confidence that we will continue to deliver industry-leading growth\". Sanofi provides healthcare solutions to over 100 countries worldwide and has three core focuses: speciality care, vaccines, and general medicines. Over the last half century, Sanofi has grown into one of the world’s leading healthcare companies and is the eighth largest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue in 2024. In 2023, Sanofi generated sales of €43bn (US$46.16bn) with growth up 2% year on year mainly driven by Dupixent, eczema treatment, and vaccines which benefited from the launch performance of Beyfortus (vaccine for Respiratory Syncytial Virus). In a similar strategic move to GSK, in late 2023 Sanofi announced, as part of their play to win strategy, that they planned tospin off their OTCbusiness to focus on increasing investment in their prescription portfolio, this is expected to close in Q4 2024. In line with this approach, at the end of 2023, the company signed a $140 million partnership with French tech company, Aqemia. Together,Sanofi and Aqemia plan to revolutionise drug discoveryby leveraging Aqemia’s physics algorithms and generative artificial intelligence. In the2023 earnings report, CEO of Sanofi, Paul Hudson commented, “2023 was a turning-point year for Sanofi, paving the way for our scientific leadership in Immunology. Coupled with our AI at-scale ambitions, we go forward as a development-driven, tech-powered biopharma company committed to serving patients and accelerating growth”. With over 128 years ofhistory in medical innovation, Roche is at the forefront of oncology, immunology, infectious diseases, ophthalmology and neuroscience, and is split into two divisions: pharma and diagnostics. The pharmaceutical segment continued to account for nearly three quarters of the company’s overall income, withsales totalling CHF44.6bn (US$49.9bn), a slight decline from the previous year when sales reached CHF45.6bn. Oncology treatment, Phesgo, drove a steady performance (+2% to CHF1.1bn). Ophthalmology medication, approved by the FDA and EMA in 2022, Vabysmo gained momentous traction in 2023 up 85% to CFH2.4bn. This offset the sharp drop in demand and sales for Covid-19 products which also negatively impacted the diagnostics division. Marking a steady performance in 2023 and looking to the future, Roche CEO, Thomas Schinecker commented “We also made good progress in both our pharma and diagnostics product pipeline. One recent highlight is inavolisib, an oral therapy investigated in phase III trials which showed a reduction of more than 50% in the risk of death or worsening disease for patients suffering from advanced, hardto-treat breast cancer. We look forward to bringing this medicine to patients as soon as possible. Our new partnerships and acquisitions address disease areas with high unmet needs, such as inflammatory bowel disease and cardiometabolic disease. We are well positioned for future growth”. Merck & Co remains in fourth place in 2024. With over 130 years in business, Merck is headquartered in New Jersey and focuses on pharmaceuticals, vaccines and animal health. In 2023,Merck & Co’s human health division revenues totalled US$53.6bn, up 3%thanks to sustained growth across oncology and vaccines. Over the last few years, Merck & Co has made their way up the ranks thanks to their blockbuster cancer immunotherapy, Keytruda. In 2023, Keytruda accounted for over 46% of the company’s pharmaceutical revenues, with sales reaching US$25bn (+19%).  Increased sales for Gardasil HPV vaccine (+29%) and MMRV vaccines (+6%), also helped to boost Merck’s pharma division. Further growth in 2023 was partially offset by lower sales of Januvia and Janumet, down 23%, owing to increased generic competition and a decline for Pneumovax 23, pneumococcal vaccine. As Keytruda, moves toward the loss of market exclusivity in 2028, Merck has had to look for new avenues for growth. In April 2023, Merck announced it would acquire Prometheus Biosciences and in 2024 they confirmed they would buy Harpoon Therapeutics for US$680mn, accelerating their growing presence in immunology. Robert M. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck said “2023 was another very strong year for Merck. I am extremely pleased by the progress we’ve made to develop and deliver transformative therapies and vaccines that will help save and improve lives around the world. We reached more than 500 million people with our medicines last year alone, over half of which were donations, including through our program to treat river blindness,” said Robert M. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “We also made investments of approximately $30 billion in research and development in our ongoing effort to discover, develop and collaborate to propel the next generation of impactful innovations. As we move forward, I’m confident that our strong momentum will continue, underpinned by the unwavering dedication of our talented global team”. With over 50,000 employees spread over 70 countries, innovation-driven AbbVie secures it’s spot in the top 3. AbbVie was created in 2013, when the company separated from Abbott, and tends to drive its R&D efforts towards difficult-to-cure diseases. Seven years later in 2020, AbbVie successfully acquired Allergan, which has strengthened the company’s position in a number of therapeutic areas including immunology, oncology and neuroscience. In 2023, sales totalled US$54.3bn, down 6% YOY owing to declines for immunology with the loss of exclusivity for arthritis drug, Humira and oncology with revenues for Imbruvica, which is now subject to theMedicare price negotiations, decreasing by 19%. Although they are yet to see the true impact, AbbVie lost market exclusivity in the US for Humira, the company’s top drug and the bestselling non-covid product in biopharma history. Which means AbbVie must find other avenues for revenue and the company is hoping immunology duo Skyrizi (+50%) and Rinvoq (+64%) will be their next star performers. In a press release announcing the company’sfull year results, Richard A. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive officer, AbbVie commented \"2023 was another outstanding year, marked by strong operational execution and significant overperformance from our non-Humira growth platform. During the year we meaningfully increased R&D investment and bolstered our pipeline with the proposed ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisitions,\" he went on to add, \"2024 is an exciting year for AbbVie, as we are well positioned to fully absorb Humira erosion and achieve modest operational revenue growth, followed by a return to robust growth in 2025 and a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade”. Johnson & Johnson, also referred to as J&J, leapfrogs AbbVie into second place in 2024. With headquarters based in New Jersey, Johnson & Johnson develops and produces pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer health goods. For the company’s innovative medicine division, revenues increased by 4% on both a reported and operational basis in the full year of 2023. This was driven by a number of key performers, including Darzalex, a treatment of multiple myeloma, Stelara, a treatment of a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, Tremfya, a plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis treatment, Erleada, a prostate cancer drug and  multiple myeloma medication, Teclistamab. In anearnings report, Joaquin Duato, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, said “. “Johnson & Johnson’s full year 2023 results reflect the breadth and competitiveness of our business and our relentless focus on delivering for patients,” he went on to say “We have entered 2024 from a position of strength, and I am confident in our ability to lead the next wave of health innovation”. American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation, Pfizer remains in the top spot in 2024 for the third year in a row. Pfizer specialises in the development of medicines and vaccines across a wide range of disciplines including immunology, oncology, cardiology and neurology. Since the spin-off of Upjohn, which completed in 2020, the company has moved forward as a single focused innovative biopharmaceutical company, working on the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. In the fiscal year of 2023,Pfizer’s revenues totalled $58.5bn, down 42% from 2022 where the company’s sales reached an impressive US$100bn thanks to its top-selling product Comirnaty, mRNA vaccine for Covid-19. Excluding contributions from its COVID portfolio, Pfizer achieved 7% operational revenue growth in 2023, with substantial contributions from new product and indication launches and growth from key brands. Paving new ways for future growth, Pfizer worked to build a strong foundation for 2024 and beyond. In 2023, the FDA greenlit 9 New Molecular Entity approvals which is expected to greatly bolster Pfizer’s portfolio in the coming years. Furthermore, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Seagen Inc at the end of 2023, one of the largest investments in Pfizer’s history. The acquisition positions Pfizer to deliver the potential next generation of transformative cancer treatments. David Denton, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, commented “We are pleased with the strong 8% operational revenue growth of Pfizer’s non-COVID products in the fourth quarter of 2023, achieving our full-year 2023 non-COVID operational revenue growth target of 6% to 8%,” he went on to say, “We are prepared to execute our commercial strategy to drive continued growth from our newly launched and acquired products, and to deliver on our targeted cost savings that we expect will expand our operating margins in 2024 and beyond”.

       "   \"Pfizer held nine percent of the world's pharmaceutical drug market in 2022. The global market for prescribed medicines is expected to be led by U.S. companies, accompanied by Swiss pharma giants Roche and Novartis.Prescription and over-the-counter drugsThe total global prescription drug market– including generic and orphan drugs – was estimated at 1.12 trillion U.S. dollars for 2022. Especially the orphan drug market is a major driver and expected to more than double its revenues in only seven years between 2019 and 2026. Prescribed (Rx) drugs are drugs which can be only obtained with a physician’s prescription. In contrast to these, there is thegroup of so called over-the-counter (OTC) drugswhich can be purchased directly without a prescription. Typical examples for OTC drugs are lower-dosed pain killers like aspirin or ibuprofen.Pfizer as global leaderNew York City-based Pfizer has been among the largest pharmaceutical companies for many yearsbased on combined prescribed and OTC drug revenue. Today, the company is totally focused on human medicine, divided into four major segments: Primary Care, Specialty Care, Oncology, and Pfizer Centreone. Pfizer also had a significant animal health division until 2013. The company generates about half of its revenues inside the United States.Among Pfizer’s perhaps most famous drug ever produced is the potency pill Viagra.Read more\",\n",
       "   \"WARNER LAMBERT.2000: Pfizer joins forces with Warner-LambertIn 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert, bringing together two of the fastest-growing companies in the pharmaceutical industry and adding to Pfizer's global strengths and rich heritage. With Warner-Lambert, Pfizer gained product lines ranging from Parke-Davis branded pharmaceuticals to Listerine mouthwash to Schick and Wilkinson Sword wet-shave products.Warner-Lambert: A HistoryLike Pfizer, Warner-Lambert traces its history back to the mid-1800s, the opportune days of a growing America. In 1856, William R. Warner launched his own drug store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. An innovator at heart, he invented a tablet-coating process to encase harsh-tasting medicines in sugar shells. This innovation earned Warner a place in the Smithsonian Institution.Warner gave up his retail shop in 1886. He then focused solely on drug manufacturing under the name William R. Warner & Co.Meanwhile, in the American midwest, Jordan Wheat Lambert was launching Lambert Pharmacal company in St. Louis. Lambert's main product was Listerine®antiseptic, and it was marketed only to medical professionals. Lambert soon realized that Listerine had huge consumer marketing potential. In 1914, he began to mass-market Listerine through an advertising campaign that is still a case model in business schools.Another St. Louis-based company, Pfeiffer Chemical, bought William R. Warner in 1908, kept the Warner name, and expanded the company through acquisition.The paths of Warner´s company and Lambert´s firm intersected in 1955, with the creation of the Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical Company.Warner-Lambert grew through acquisition. One of the earliest came in 1962, when the company bought American Chicle Company, a New York City-based company that was among the world's largest producers of gums and mints. American Chicle's flagship brand name, Adams, was well known around the world and its products included Dentyne®, Chiclets®and Trident®gums, and Certs®and Clorets®mints. In 1965, Warner-Lambert purchased a small cough tablet company in the United Kingdom and expanded the brand known as Halls®Mentholyptus to global stature.In 1970, Warner-Lambert acquired the Schick®wet-shave product line from Eversharp. The company was founded in 1929 by Jacob Schick, whose magazine-loading razor was inspired by the repeating rifle.1970 also saw the deal that transformed Warner-Lambert: the acquisition of Parke-Davis, once the world's largest drugmaker.Parke-Davis traces its history back to 1866, when Hervey Parke and George Davis formed a small company in Detroit, Michigan.They pioneered the standardization of medications and built the first modern pharmaceutical laboratory. They also developed the first organized, systematic method of clinically testing new drugs.In the first half of the 20th Century, Parke-Davis introduced a number of breakthrough products, including the first bacterial vaccine, a pure form of adrenaline, andDilantin®(phenytoin), the first widely available treatment for epilepsy and seizure. Dilantin®remains a valuable therapy against convulsions.After World War II, Parke-Davis popularized a number of anti-infectives, developed the Salk polio vaccine for widespread use, and introduced a new line of oral contraceptives.In 1976, the acquisition of Parke-Davis was approved by the United States Government and in the mid-1980s, Warner-Lambert refocused on three main businesses: prescription pharmaceuticals, consumer health care products, and gums and mints. The company grew with the introduction, in the early 1980s, of the first effective cholesterol-lowering agent, Lopid.In 1993, Warner-Lambert acquired Wilkinson Sword, combining it with Schick®to create the world's second largest wet-shave business. However, a far greater expansion of the company came in 1996, when Warner-Lambert entered into a co-marketing agreement with Pfizer onLipitor®(atorvastatin calcium), a new entry into the statin class of lipid-lowering agents. Discovered by Parke-Davis Research and introduced in 1997, Lipitor®is the largest-selling pharmaceutical of any kind worldwide.In 1999, Warner-Lambert acquired Agouron, based in La Jolla, California. Agouron is a leader in protein-based drug design and marketer of the protease inhibitor, Viracept®(nelfinavir mesylate).Pfizer and Warner-Lambert announced their intention to join, a transaction completed in June 2000, creating the world's most valuable and fastest-growing pharmaceutical company.\",\n",
       "   \"Faceless private equities and hedge funds control the firms essential to our health and survival. Pfizer is among the Big Pharma firms in which institutional investors have bought a stake over the years. How often do you hear about Dodge & Cox, SSgA Funds Management, BlackRock, Mawer Investment or The Vanguard Group? Well, if you recently popped a Tylenol for a headache, took a Lantus insulin shot or got your kid a flu shot at the local clinic - then you’ve probably come across these investment funds as they own the pharmaceutical firms that made those drugs. In the last two decades, private equities and investment management companies — known as institutional investors — have mopped up the majority shareholding in the world’s largest medicine-makers. Many of these investors simultaneously hold stakes in more than one large pharmaceutical company and their generic counterparts, something known as “common ownership”. This has raised concern that it undermines competition and as a result consumers end up paying more. A recentpaperco-authored by researchers Albert Banal-Estanol, Melissa Newham and Jo Seldeslachts for DIW Berlin found that large pharmaceutical companies have become connected to each other through their shareholders. “Public companies are increasingly owned by a handful of large institutional investors so we expected to see many ownership links between companies — what was more surprising was the magnitude of common ownership,” the authors toldTRT Worldin an emailed response. “We frequently find that more than 50 percent of a company is owned by ‘common’ shareholders who also own stakes in rival pharma companies.” For instance in 2014, the same investors collectively owned half the shares of Switzerland-based Novartis and Germany’s Bayer, the maker of Aspirin. The three largest shareholders of Pfizer, J&J and Merck are Vanguard, SSGA and BlackRock, the multi-trillion dollar funds which make investments on behalf of their clients and keep a cut for their service. What institutional investors do is perfectly legal. They are not even reviewed by competition authorities as long as an investor such as BlackRock keeps its shareholding at less than 10 percent in a pharma firm. They are classified as passive investors. “The concern is how passive are they?” the DIW Berlin report authors said. Institutional investors may not directly interfere in a pharma company’s day-to-day business. But knowing who the shareholders are and their stake in rival companies, the pharma executives can end up working in the interest of common institutional investors, they said. “The increase in connectivity between brand firms (such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca) may also affect drug prices. This is because economic theory clearly indicates that intense price competition between firms that share the same owner, ultimately reduces the profits of the common owner.” Institutional investors having a stake in multiple Big Pharma firms at the same time may hamper efforts to find new medicines for diseases. “This is potentially to the detriment of consumers if it means that fewer drug variants are available,” the authors said. Pharmaceutical companies spend considerable sums of money on bringing new drugs to the market. They prefer monopolies and resist the entry of generic makers. To counter such competition, large industry players such as J&J, Pfizer, Novartis and Merck have bought stakes in generic drug companies like Perrigo. Where the Big Pharma faces difficulty in acquiring generic makers such as those in India, it refuses to share patents and knowhow even during a health emergency like was seen recently in the run-up to make Covid-19 vaccines. The involvement of institutional investors might also be having an impact on how pharma companies reward their shareholders. Pharma companies have become money-making machines and this is evident from the massive increase in returns they have given to their shareholders in the past two decades. “Payouts to shareholders have increased by almost 400 per cent — from $30 billion in 2000 to $146 billion in 2018,” the Amsterdam-based Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations said in areportlast year. Put another way, the return to shareholders went up from 88 percent of investment in R&D to 123 percent in the same period. The authors of this report looked at the financial statements of 27 largest pharma companies and found that shareholders netted a total of $1.54 trillion in profits over the 18 year period. That’s more than $1.4 trillion the companies poured into R&D for new medicines. The pharma industry has become hostage to what’s known as financialisation — a practice in which a company uses its resources to reward the shareholders instead of investing it in plants, machinery and labs. For instance, companies use the strength of their balance sheets to borrow money from banks and then use the cash to buy their own shares from the stock market. Such share buybacks inflate the value of the remaining stock, consequently increasing the net worth of the largest shareholders. “When you look at the financial statements of pharma companies and see Blackrock and other funds as shareholders it tells you something immediately,” said Gerlad Posner, the author of Pharma, a book on history of the industry. “These are groups with big profit margins and they don't invest in industries which are not giving a return on the bottom line.”\",\n",

Pfizer continued to buy property in the area (by now the Williamsburg district of the city ofBrooklyn, New Yorkand beginning in 1898, theCity of Greater New York) to expand its lab and factory, retaining offices on Flushing Avenue until the 1960s; the Brooklyn plant ultimately closed in 2009.[7]Following their success with citric acid, Pfizer (at the now-demolished 295 Washington Avenue) and Erhart (at 280 Washington Avenue) established their main residences in the nearbyClinton Hilldistrict, known for its concentration ofGilded Agewealth.[citation needed]In 1881, Pfizer moved its administrative headquarters to 81 Maiden Lane inManhattan, presaging the company\\'s expansion toChicago, Illinoisa year later.[6][8]By 1906 sales exceeded $3million.[9]World War Icaused a shortage ofcalcium citrate. Pfizer imported the compound from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and due to the disruption in supply, the company began a search for an alternative.[10]They found this in the form of afunguscapable of fermenting sugar to citric acid. By 1919, the company was able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source.[10]The company developed expertise in fermentation technology as a result. These skills were applied to thedeep-submergence mass productionofpenicillin, anantibiotic, duringWorld War IIin response to the need to treat injured Allied soldiers.[11]The company also embarked on a globalsoilcollection program related to improving production yields of penicillin which ultimately resulted in 135,000 samples.[12]On June 2, 1942, the company incorporated under theDelaware General Corporation Law.[1]1950–1980: Pivot to pharmaceutical research and global expansion[edit]Due to price declines forpenicillin, Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. Pfizer discoveredoxytetracyclinein 1950, and this changed the company from a manufacturer offine chemicalsto a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer developed adrug discoveryprogram focused on in vitro synthesis to augment its research in fermentation technology. In 1959, the company established ananimal healthdivision with a 700-acre (2.8\\xa0km2) farm and research facility inTerre Haute, Indiana.[11]By the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980, Pfizer launched Feldene (piroxicam), a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer\\'s first product to reach $1billion in revenue.[9]In 1965, John Powers, Jr. becamechief executive officerof the company, succeeding John McKeen.[9]As the area surrounding its Brooklyn, NY plant fell into decline in the 1970s and 1980s, the company formed a public-private partnership with New York City that encompassed the construction of low- and middle-income housing, the refurbishment of apartment buildings for the homeless and the establishment of acharter school.[8]In 1972,Edmund T. Pratt Jr.becamechief executive officerof the company, succeeding John Powers, Jr.[9]1980–2000: Development of Viagra, Zoloft, and Lipitor[edit]In 1981, the company received approval for Diflucan (fluconazole), the first oral treatment for severefungal infectionsincludingcandidiasis,blastomycosis,coccidiodomycosis,cryptococcosis,histoplasmosis,dermatophytosis, andpityriasis versicolor.[13]In 1986, Pfizer acquired the worldwide rights to Zithromax (azithromycin), a macrolide antibiotic that is recommended by theInfectious Disease Society of Americaas a first line treatment for certain cases of community-acquired pneumonia, fromPliva.[14][15]In 1989, Pfizer scientists Peter Dunn and Albert Wood created Viagra (sildenafil) for treatinghigh blood pressureandangina, a chest pain associated withcoronary artery disease. In 1991, it was patented in the United Kingdom as a heart medication. Early trials for the medication showed that it did not work for the treatment of heart disease, but volunteers in the clinical trials had increasederectionsseveral days after taking the drug. It was patented in the United States in 1996 and received approval by theFood and Drug Administrationin March 1998. In December 1998, Pfizer hiredBob Doleas a spokesperson for the drug.[16]The patents for Viagra expired in 2020.[17]In 1991,William C. Steere, Jr.becamechief executive officersof the company, succeedingEdmund T. Pratt Jr.[18]In 1991 Pfizer also began marketing Zoloft (sertraline), anantidepressantof theselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor(SSRI) class developed nine years earlier by Pfizer chemistsKenneth Koeand Willard Welch. Sertraline is primarily prescribed formajor depressive disorderin adultoutpatientsas well asobsessive-compulsive disorder,panic disorder, andsocial anxiety disorderin both adults and children. In 2005, the year before it became a generic drug, sales were over $3billion and over 100million people had been treated with the drug.[19]The patent for Zoloft expired in the summer of 2006.[20]In 1996,Eisai, in partnership with Pfizer, receivedapprovalfrom theFood and Drug Administrationfordonepezilunder the brand Aricept for treatment ofAlzheimer\\'s disease;[21]Pfizer also received approval for Norvasc (amlodipine), anantihypertensivedrug of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker class.[22]Bottles of Zoloft (sertraline), anantidepressantIn 1997, the company entered into a co-marketing agreement withWarner–Lambertfor Lipitor (atorvastatin), astatinfor the treatment ofhypercholesterolemia. Although atorvastatin was the fifthstatinto be developed, clinical trials showed that atorvastatin caused a more dramatic reduction inlow-density lipoproteinpattern C (LDL-C) than the other statin drugs. Upon its patent expiration in 2011, Lipitor was the best-selling drug ever, with approximately $125billion in sales over 14.5 years.[23]2000–2010: Further expansion[edit]In 2001,Henry McKinnellbecamechief executive officerof the company, replacingWilliam C. Steere, Jr.[24]In 2002, TheBill & Melinda Gates Foundationpurchased stock in Pfizer.[25]In 2004, the company received approval for Lyrica (pregabalin), ananticonvulsantandanxiolyticmedication used to treatepilepsy,neuropathic pain,fibromyalgia,restless leg syndrome, andgeneralized anxiety disorder.[26][27][28]The United States patent on Lyrica was challenged by generic manufacturers and was upheld in 2014, extending the expiration date to 2018.[29]In July 2006,Jeff Kindlerwas namedchief executive officerof the company, replacingHenry McKinnell.[24][30]On December 3, 2006, Pfizer ceased development oftorcetrapib, a drug that increases production ofHDL, which reducesLDLthought to be correlated to heart disease. During aPhase III clinical trialinvolving 15,000 patients, more deaths than expected occurred in the group that took the medicine, and themortality rateof patients taking the combination of torcetrapib and Lipitor (82 deaths during the study) was 60% higher than those taking Lipitor alone (52 deaths during the study). Lipitor alone was not implicated in the results, but Pfizer lost nearly $1billion developing the failed drug and its stock price dropped 11% on the day of the announcement.[31][32][33][34]Between 2007 and 2010, Pfizer spent $3.3million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about $5.1million, and had another $5million of pending recoveries from civil lawsuits against makers ofcounterfeitprescription drugs. Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts worldwide to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits fortrademark infringement.[35]In July 2008, Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at its manufacturing facility inPortage, Michigan. Portage was previously the world headquarters ofUpjohn Company, which had been acquired as part of Pharmacia.[36][37]Acquisitions and mergers[edit]In June 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert outright for $116billion. To satisfy conditions imposed by antitrust regulators at theFederal Trade Commission, Pfizer sold off or transferred stakes in several minor products, including RID (a shampoo for treatment ofhead lice, sold toBayer) and Warner-Lambert\\'s antidepressantCelexa(which competes with Zoloft).[38]The acquisition created what was, at the time, the second-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.[39]In 2003, Pfizer merged withPharmacia, and in the process acquiredSearleandSUGEN. Searle had developed Flagyl (metronidazole), anitroimidazoleantibiotic medication used particularly foranaerobicbacteriaandprotozoa.[37][40]Searle also developedcelecoxib(Celebrex) aCOX-2 inhibitorandnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug(NSAID) used to treat thepainandinflammationinosteoarthritis,acute painin adults,rheumatoid arthritis,ankylosing spondylitis,painful menstruation, andjuvenile rheumatoid arthritis.[41]SUGEN, a company focused onprotein kinaseinhibitors, had pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to blocksignal transduction. TheSUGENfacility was shut down in 2003 by Pfizer, with the loss of more than 300 jobs, and several programs were transferred to Pfizer. These includedsunitinib(Sutent), a cancer medication which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006.[42][43]A related compound, SU11654 (Toceranib), was also approved forcancer in dogs, and theALK inhibitorCrizotinibalso grew out of a SUGEN program.[44][45]In October 2006, the company announced it would acquire PowerMed.[46]On October 15, 2009, Pfizer acquiredWyethfor $68billion in cash and stock, including the assumption of debt, making Pfizer the largest pharmaceutical company in the world.[47][48][49][50][51]The acquisition of Wyeth provided Pfizer with apneumococcal conjugate vaccine, trademarkedPrevnar 13; this is used for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal infections. The introduction of the original, 7-valent version of the vaccine, developed byWyethin February 2000, led to a 75% reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections among children under age5 in the United States. Pfizer introduced an improved version of the vaccine in 2010, for which it was granted a patent in India in 2017. Prevnar 13 provides coverage of 13 bacterial variants, expanding beyond the original 7-valent version.[51]By 2012, the rate of invasive infections among children under age5 had been reduced by an additional 50%.[52][53]2010–2020: Further discoveries and acquisitions[edit]Entrance to former Pfizer World Headquarters building (1961–2023)In 2010,Ian Readwas namedchief executive officerof the company.[54]In February 2011, Pfizer announced the closure of its UK research and development facility (formerly also a manufacturing plant) inSandwich, Kent, which at the time employed 2,400 people.[55]In March 2011, Pfizer acquiredKing Pharmaceuticalsfor $3.6billion in cash. King produced emergency injectables such as theEpiPen.[56]On September 4, 2012, the FDA approvedbosutinib(Bosulif) forchronic myelogenous leukemia(CML), a rare type ofleukemiaand a blood andbone marrowdisease that affects primarily older adults.[57]In November 2012, Pfizer received approval from theFood and Drug Administrationfor Xeljanz, atofacitinib, forrheumatoid arthritisandulcerative colitis.[58]The drug had sales of $1.77billion in 2018, and in January 2019, it was the top drug in the United States fordirect-to-consumer advertising, passingadalimumab(Humira).[59]On February 1, 2013,Zoetis, the Agriculture Division of Pfizer and later Pfizer Animal Health, became apublic companyvia aninitial public offering, raising $2.2billion.[60][61][62][63]Later in 2013, Pfizer completed thecorporate spin-offof its remaining stake inZoetis.[64][65]In September 2014, the company acquired Innopharma for $225million, plus up to $135million in milestone payments, in a deal that expanded Pfizer\\'s range of generic and injectable drugs.[66][67]On January 5, 2015, the company announced it would acquire a controlling interest in Redvax, expanding its vaccine portfolio targeting humancytomegalovirus.[68]In February 2015, the company received approval from theFood and Drug Administrationforpalbociclib(Ibrance) for treatment of certain types ofbreast cancer.[69][70]In March 2015, the company announced it would restart its collaboration withEli Lilly and Companysurrounding thePhase III trialofTanezumab.[71]In May 2015, Pfizer and aBar-Ilan Universitylaboratory announced a partnership based on the development of medicalDNA nanotechnology.[72]In June 2015, the company acquired Nimenrix and Mencevax,meningococcal vaccines, from GlaxoSmithKline for around $130million.[73]In September 2015, Pfizer acquiredHospirafor $17billion, including the assumption of debt.[74][75][76][77][78][79]Hospirawas the largest producer of generic injectable pharmaceuticals in the world.[80]On November 23, 2015, Pfizer andAllerganannounced a planned $160billion merger, in the largest pharmaceutical deal ever and the third largest corporate merger in history. The proposed transaction contemplated that the merged company maintain Allergan\\'sRepublic of Irelanddomicile, resulting in the new company being subject tocorporation taxat the relatively low rate of 12.5%.[81]The deal was to constitute areverse merger, whereby Allergan acquired Pfizer, with the new company then changing its name to \"Pfizer, plc\".[82][83][84]On April 6, 2016, Pfizer and Allergan terminated the merger agreement after theObama administrationand theUnited States Department of the Treasuryintroduced new laws intended to limitcorporate inversions(the extent to which companies could move their headquarters overseas in order to reduce the amount of taxes they pay).[85][86]In June 2016, the company acquired Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2billion, expanding its portfolio in both inflammation and immunology drugs areas.[87][88]In August 2016, the company made a $40million bid for the assets of BIND Therapeutics, which was inbankruptcy.[89]The same month, the company acquired Bamboo Therapeutics for $645million, expanding its gene therapy offerings.[90]In September 2016, the company acquired cancer drug-makerMedivationfor $14billion.[91][92][93]In October 2016, the company licensed the anti-CTLA4monoclonal antibody, ONC-392, from OncoImmune.[94][95]In November 2016, Pfizer funded a $3,435,600 study with theCDC Foundationto research \"screen-and-treat\" strategies forcryptococcal diseaseinBotswana.[96]In December 2016, Pfizer acquiredAstraZeneca\\'s small-molecule antibiotics business for $1.575 billion.[97][98][99]In January 2018, Pfizer announced that it would end its work on research into treatments forAlzheimer\\'s diseaseandParkinsonism(a symptom ofParkinson\\'s diseaseand other conditions). The company said about 300 researchers would lose their jobs.[100]In July 2018, theFood and Drug Administrationapprovedenzalutamide, developed by Pfizer andAstellas Pharmafor patients withcastration-resistantprostate cancer.[101]In August 2018, Pfizer signed an agreement withBioNTechto conduct joint research and development activities regardingmRNA-basedinfluenza vaccines.[102]In October 2018, effective January 1, 2019,Albert Bourlawas promoted tochief executive officer, succeedingIan Read, his mentor.[103][104][105][106]In July 2019, the company acquired Therachon for up to $810million, expanding its rare disease portfolio through Therachon\\'s recombinant human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 compound, aimed at treating conditions such asachondroplasia.[107]Also in July, Pfizer acquiredArray Biopharmafor $10.6billion, boosting its oncology pipeline.[108]In August 2019, Pfizer merged its consumer health business with that of GlaxoSmithKline, into ajoint ventureowned 68% by GlaxoSmithKline and 32% by Pfizer, with plans to make it apublic company. The transaction built on a 2018 transaction where GlaxoSmithKline acquiredNovartis\\' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business.[109]The transaction followed negotiations with other companies includingReckitt Benckiser,[110]Sanofi,Johnson & Johnson,[111]andProcter & Gamble.[112]In September 2019, Pfizer initiated a study with theCDC Foundationto investigate the tracking ofhealthcare-associated infections, scheduled to run through to June 2023.[96]In December 2019, Pfizer awarded the CDC Foundation a further $1,948,482 to continue itscryptococcal diseasescreening and treatment research in nine African countries.[96]2020: COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine development[edit]In March 2020, Pfizer joined the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator funding vehicle to expedite development oftreatments against COVID-19.[113][114]The $125 million initiative was launched by theBill & Melinda Gates Foundationin partnership withMastercardandWellcome Trust, with additional funding announced shortly after fromChan Zuckerberg Initiative,UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeandMadonna.[115][116]The following month, theFoundation for the National Institutes of Healthannounced the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership to develop a coordinated research strategy for prioritizing and speeding up development of COVID-19 vaccines and pharmaceutical products.[117]Pfizer joined the partnership as an industry \"leadership organization\", and participated as a collaborator in ACTIV-led clinical trials.[118][119]CEOAlbert Bourlaattended theGAVICOVAX AMC2021 Investment Opportunity Launch Event, otherwise named One World Protected, on April 15, 2021.[120]In Canada, Pfizer endorsed the use of avaccine passportmobile appdeveloped by CANImmunize in order to record and track status of COVID-19 vaccination.[121]As the scale of theCOVID-19 pandemicbecame apparent, Pfizer partnered with BioNTech to study and developCOVID-19mRNA vaccine candidates. Unlike many of its competitors, Pfizer took no initial research funds from the United States\\'Operation Warp Speedvaccine development program, instead choosing to invest roughly $2 billion of its own funds. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has said that he declined money from Operation Warp Speed to avoid government intervention, stating later that \"when you get money from someone that always comes with strings. They want to see how we are going to progress, what type of moves you are going to do. They want reports. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics, by the way.\"[122]In May 2020, Pfizer began testing four differentCOVID-19 vaccinevariations usinglipid nanoparticletechnology provided by Canadian biotechnology companyAcuitas Therapeutics.[123]Vaccines were injected into the first human participants in the U.S. in early May. In July 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that two of the partners\\' fourmRNAvaccine candidates had won fast track designation from theFDA.[124]The company began PhaseII-III testing on 30,000 people in the last week of July 2020 and was slated to be paid $1.95billion for 100million doses of the vaccine by the US government.[125]In September 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they had completed talks with the European Commission to provide an initial 200million vaccine doses to the EU, with the option to supply another 100million doses at a later date.[126]On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BioNTech\\'s COVID-19 vaccine, tested on 43,500 people, was found to be 90% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19.[127]The efficacy was updated to 95% a week later.[128]Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist interviewed byThe New York Times, described the efficacy figure as \"really a spectacular number.\"[129]The announcement made Pfizer and BioNTech the first companies to develop and test a working vaccine for COVID-19.[128]Over the following month and a half, regulators in various countries approved Pfizer\\'s vaccine for emergency use.[130][131][132][133][134][135][136][137]Controversy[edit]In February 2021, after a year long investigation relying on unnamed officials, Pfizer was accused byThe Bureau of Investigative Journalism(TBIJ) of employing \"high-level bullying\" against at least twoLatin Americancountries during negotiations to acquire COVID-19 vaccines, including requesting that the countries put sovereign assets ascollateralfor payments.[138]According to TBIJ, these negotiation tactics resulted in a months long delay in Pfizer reaching a vaccine agreement with one country and a complete failure to reach agreements with two other countries, includingArgentinaand Brazil.[138]In November 2021, TBMJ published an article after obtaining information from awhistleblowerfrom the Ventavia Research Group. Ventavia was hired by Pfizer as a research subcontractor. A regional director (whistleblower) who was employed at Ventavia Research Group has toldThe BMJthat the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported inPfizer\\'s pivotal phase III trial. The regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the USFood and Drug Administration(FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.[139]TheEuropean Medicines Agency(EMA) stated in a response to theEuropean Parliament, that \"the deficiencies identified do not jeopardize the quality and integrity of the data from the main Comirnaty trial and have no impact on the benefit-risk assessment or on the conclusions on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine\".[140]Science-Based Medicineemphasized that Ventavia oversaw just three of the 153 clinical sites involved with Pfizer\\'s trial and \"a small fraction (~1,000 by the time the whistleblower was fired) of the trial\\'s over ~44,000 subjects.\"[141]On 10 October 2022, during a session of theEuropean Parliament\\'s Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic, Pfizer executive Janine Small testified that the company had not evaluated theirCOVID-19 vaccinefor its ability to reduce transmission of theSARS-CoV-2virus prior to its release to the general public.[142][143]Dutch MEPRob Roosdescribed the admission as \"scandalous\".[144]CEOAlbert Bourlawas slated to attend, but withdrew.[145]Roos\\' statements in turn have been described as \"misleading\".[146]Development of oral antivirals[edit]In November 2021, Pfizer launched a new COVID-19 oral antivirus treatment known asPaxlovid. In January 2022, the Pfizer CEOAlbert Bourlaconfirmed that the trial results of a fourth dose were pending until March 2022. He said that the firm was setting up a collaboration to develop an anti-COVID pill treatment along with a French company,Novasep. He also said the COVID vaccine was \"safe and efficient\" for children.[147][148]In May 2022, reports emerged of patients experiencing \"rebound\" symptoms after completing a five-day course of Paxlovid.[149]The FDA responded by announcing they had performed additional analyses of the drug\\'s clinical trial data, and decided against changing its recommendations.[150]U.S. PresidentJoe Bidenand Dr.Anthony Fauciwere both reported to experience this rebound syndrome in the months that followed, while continuing to recommend the drug for those who may benefit from it.[151]Late 2020–onwards: Corporate developments and acquisitions[edit]In September 2020, the company acquired a 9.9% stake in CStone Pharmaceuticals for $200million (HK$1.55billion), helping to commercialise its anti-PD-L1monoclonal antibody, CS1001.[152]In October 2020, the company acquired Arixa Pharmaceuticals.[153]In November 2020, using aReverse Morris Truststructure, Pfizer merged its off-patent branded andgeneric drugbusiness, known as Upjohn, withMylanto formViatris, owned 57% by Pfizer shareholders.[154][155]On January 5, 2021, Pfizer introduced a newlogo.[156]In April 2021, Pfizer acquired Amplyx Pharmaceuticals and its anti-fungal compoundfosmanogepix(APX001).[157][158]In August, the company announced it would acquire Trillium Therapeutics Inc and its immuno-oncology portfolio for $2.3 billion.[159][160]In March 2022, the company acquiredArena Pharmaceuticalsfor $6.7 billion in cash.[161][162][163]In June 2022, the company acquired ReViral Ltd, for up to $525 million, gaining access to experimental drugs used to combatrespiratory syncytial virusinfections.[164][165]In October 2022, the company acquired Biohaven Pharma and itscalcitonin gene-related peptideprograms for $11.6 billion.[166][167][168]It also acquired Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion, boosting Pfizer\\'s rare disease business.[169][170][171]In April 2023, Pfizer moved its world headquarters from42nd StreetinMidtown Manhattanto the Spiral atHudson Yards.[172][173]In December 2023, the company acquiredSeagen, a pioneer ofantibody–drug conjugatesfor the treatment of cancer, for $43billion.[174][175]On Sept 30, 2024, Pfizer announced its intentions to sell 540 million Haleon shares whose worth is about\\xa0 £2.1 billion ($2.8 billion)\\xa0 according to Bloomberg calculations.[176]Acquisition history[edit]Pfizer acquisitionsPfizer(Founded 1849 as Charles Pfizer & Company)Warner–Lambert(Acq 2000)William R.

Parke-DavisPfizer has been accused of aggressivepharmaceutical marketing.[177][178][179]2004 Illegal marketing of gabapentin for off-label uses settlement[edit]In 1993, theFood and Drug Administration(FDA) approvedgabapentinonly for treatment ofseizures.Warner–Lambert, which merged with Pfizer in 2000, usedcontinuing medical educationandmedical research, sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote gabapentin. Within five years, the drug was being widely used foroff-label usessuch as treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Warner–Lambert admitted to violating FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses.[180]In 2004, the company paid $430million in one of the largest settlements to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges. It was the first off-label promotion case successfully brought under theFalse Claims Act.[181]A Cochrane review concluded that gabapentin is ineffective in migraine prophylaxis.[182]TheAmerican Academy of Neurologyrates it as having unproven efficacy, while theCanadian Headache Societyand theEuropean Federation of Neurological Societiesrate its use as being supported by moderate and low-quality evidence.[183]2009 Illegal marketing of Bextra settlement[edit]In September 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing ofarthritisdrugvaldecoxib(Bextra) and agreed to a $2.3billion settlement, the largesthealth care fraudsettlement at that time.[184]Pfizer promoted the sale of the drug for several uses and dosages that theFood and Drug Administrationspecifically declined to approve due to safety concerns. The drug was pulled from the market in 2005.[185]It was Pfizer\\'s fourth such settlement in a decade.[186][187][188]The payment included $1.195billion in criminal penalties for felony violations of theFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and $1.0billion to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by theFood and Drug Administration(FDA) leading to violations under theFalse Claims Actas reimbursements were requested from Federal and State programs. The criminal fine was the largest ever assessed in the United States to date.[186][187][188]Pfizer entered acorporate integrity agreementwith theOffice of Inspector Generalthat required it to make substantial structural reforms within the company, and publish to its website its post approval commitments and a searchable database of all payments to physicians made by the company.[189]Termination of Peter Rost[edit]Peter Rostwas vice president in charge of theendocrinologydivision atPharmaciabefore its acquisition by Pfizer. During that time he raised concerns internally aboutkickbacksand off-label marketing of Genotropin, Pharmacia\\'shuman growth hormonedrug. Pfizer reported the Pharmacia marketing practices to the FDA and Department of Justice; Rost was unaware of this and filed an FCA lawsuit against Pfizer. Pfizer kept him employed, but isolated him until the FCA suit was unsealed in 2005. The Justice Department declined to intervene, and Pfizer fired him, and he filed a wrongful termination suit against Pfizer. Pfizer won a summary dismissal of the case, with the court ruling that the evidence showed Pfizer had decided to fire Rost prior to learning of his whistleblower activities.[190][191]2014 Illegal marketing of Rapamune settlement[edit]A \"whistleblower suit\" was filed in 2005 againstWyeth, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2009, alleging that the company illegally marketedsirolimus(Rapamune) foroff-label uses, targeted specific doctors and medical facilities to increase sales of Rapamune, tried to get transplant patients to change from their transplant drugs to Rapamune, and specifically targetedAfrican-Americans. According to the whistleblowers, Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals that prescribed the drug with kickbacks such as grants, donations, and other money.[192]In 2013, the company pleaded guilty to criminal mis-branding violations under theFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. By August 2014, it had paid $491million in civil and criminal penalties related to Rapamune.[193]2014 Illegal marketing settlement[edit]In June 2010, health insurance networkBlue Cross Blue Shield(BCBS) filed a lawsuit against Pfizer for allegedly illegally marketing drugs Bextra, Geodon and Lyrica. BCBS alleged that Pfizer used kickbacks and wrongly persuaded doctors to prescribe the drugs.[194][195]According to the lawsuit, Pfizer handed out \\'misleading\\' materials onoff-label uses, sent over 5,000 doctors on trips to theCaribbeanor around the United States, and paid them $2,000 honoraria in return for listening to lectures about Bextra.[196][197]Despite Pfizer\\'s claims that \"the company\\'s intent was pure\" in fostering a legal exchange of information among doctors, an internal marketing plan revealed that Pfizer intended to train physicians \"to serve as public relations spokespeople.\"[198]The case was settled in 2014 for $325million.[199]Fearing that Pfizer is \"too big to fail\" and that prosecuting the company would result in disruptions toMedicareandMedicaid, federal prosecutors instead charged a subsidiary of a subsidiary of a subsidiary of Pfizer, which is \"nothing more than a shell company whose only function is to plead guilty.\"[198]2013 Quigley Company asbestos settlement[edit]The Quigley Company, which soldasbestos-containing insulation products until the early 1970s, was acquired by Pfizer in 1968. In June 2013, asbestos victims and Pfizer negotiated a settlement that required Pfizer to pay a total of $964million: $430million to 80% of existing plaintiffs and place an additional $535million into a settlement trust that will compensate future plaintiffs as well as the remaining 20% of plaintiffs with claims against Pfizer and Quigley. Of that $535million, $405million is in a 40-year note from Pfizer, while $100million is from insurance policies.[200]1994 Shiley defective heart valves settlement[edit]Pfizer purchased Shiley in 1979, at the onset of its Convexo-Concave valve ordeal, involving theBjork–Shiley valve. Approximately 500 people died when defectiveheart valvesfractured and, in 1994, Pfizer agreed to pay $10.75million to settle claims by theUnited States Department of Justicethat the company lied to get approval for the valves.[201]2010 Firing of employee that filed suit[edit]A federal lawsuit was filed by a scientist claiming she got an infection by a genetically modifiedlentiviruswhile working for Pfizer, resulting in intermittentparalysis.[202]A judge dismissed the case citing a lack of evidence that the illness was caused by the virus but the jury ruled that by firing the employee, Pfizer violated laws protectingfreedom of speechandwhistleblowersand awarded her $1.37million.[203]2012 Celebrex intellectual property settlement[edit]Brigham Young University(BYU) said a professor of chemistry, Dr.Daniel L. Simmons, discovered an enzyme in the 1990s that led towards development ofCelebrex. BYU was originally seeking a 15% royalty on sales, equating to $9.7billion. A research agreement had been made between BYU andMonsanto, whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a betteraspirin. The enzyme Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems and Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A six-year battle ensued because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give Dr. Simmons credit or compensation, while Pfizer claimed that it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. In May 2012, Pfizer settled the allegations, agreeing to pay $450million.[204]2011 Nigeria Trovafloxacin lawsuit settlement[edit]Main article:Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc.In 1996, an outbreak of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria. Pfizer representatives and personnel from a contract research organization (CRO) traveled toKanoto set up a clinical trial and administer an experimentalantibiotic,trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children.[205]Local Kano officials reported that more than fifty children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities.[206]The nature and frequency of both fatalities and other adverse outcomes were similar to those historically found among pediatric patients treated for meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa.[207]In 2001, families of the children, as well as the governments of Kano and Nigeria, filed lawsuits regarding the treatment.[208]According toDemocracy Now!, \"[r]esearchers did not obtain signed consent forms, and medical personnel said Pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug.\"[209]The lawsuits also accused Pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing, as well as allegedly under-dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of Trovan. Nigerian medical personnel as well as at least one Pfizer physician said the trial was conducted without regulatory approval.[210][211]In 2007, Pfizer published a Statement of Defense letter, stating that the drug\\'s oral form was safer and easier to administer. Trovan had been used safely in more than five thousand Americans prior to the Nigerian trial, and mortality in the patients treated by Pfizer was lower than that observed historically in African meningitis epidemics. No unusual side effects, unrelated to meningitis, were observed after four weeks.[212]In June 2010, the US Supreme Court rejected Pfizer\\'s appeal against a ruling allowing lawsuits by the Nigerian families to proceed.[213]In December 2010, theUnited States diplomatic cables leakindicated that Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against Nigerian attorney generalMichael Aondoakaato persuade him to drop legal action.[214]The Washington Postreporter Joe Stephens, who helped break the story in 2000, called these actions \"dangerously close to blackmail\".[209]In response, the company released a press statement describing the allegations as \"preposterous\" and saying that it acted in good faith.[215]Aondoakka, who had allegedly demanded bribes from Pfizer in return for a settlement of the case,[216]was declared unfit for office and had his U.S. visa revoked in association with corruption charges in 2010.[217][218]The lawsuits were eventually settled out of court. Pfizer committed to payingUS$35 million\"to compensate the families of children in the study\", another $30 million to \"support healthcare initiatives in Kano\", and $10 million to cover legal costs. Payouts began in 2011.[219]2022 Inflating Prices fine[edit]In July 2022, UK antitrust authorities fined Pfizer £63 million for unfairly high priced drug that aids in controlling epileptic seizures. The Competition and Markets Authority stated that the company took advantage of loopholes by de-branding epilepsy drug Epanutin, by doing so the price of Epanutin\\'s price was not regulated to the same standards the company are used to and therefore the price of the drug was raised. It was stated that over a four-year period, Pfizer had billed Epanutin for around 780% and 1,600% higher than its standard price.[220]2022 Allegations of patent infringement on mRNA technology[edit]In August 2022,Modernaannounced that it will sue Pfizer and its partnerBioNTechforinfringing their patenton the mRNA technology.[221]In May 2024, theEuropean Patent Officeupheld the validity of Moderna\\'s EP949 patent, one of the two patents asserted against Pfizer and BioNTech.[222]Environmental record[edit]Since 2000, the company has implemented more than 4,000greenhouse gasreduction projects.[223]Pfizer has inherited Wyeth\\'s liabilities in theAmerican Cyanamidsite inBridgewater Township, New Jersey, a highly toxic EPASuperfundsite. Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses.[224]TheSierra Cluband theEdison Wetlands Associationhave opposed the cleanup plan, arguing that the area is subject to flooding, which could cause pollutants to leach. The EPA considers the plan the most reasonable from considerations of safety and cost-effectiveness, arguing that an alternative plan involving truckingcontaminated soiloff site could expose cleanup workers. The EPA\\'s position is backed by the environmental watchdog group CRISIS.[225]In June 2002, a chemical explosion at the Groton plant injured 7 people and caused the evacuation of more than 100 homes in the surrounding area.[226]Public-private engagement[edit]Pfizer engages with the public and private sectors in a variety of settings including to promoteresearch and development, academic funding, event sponsorship,philanthropy, andpolitical lobbying.Academia[edit]Institute for Advanced Study– Matching gifts and direct donor.[227][228]University of Toronto– Donor to the Boundless Campaign,[229]and member of the President\\'s Circle.[230]University of Washington– Member of the Honor Roll of Donors, having contributed between $10 million and $50 million to funding the school as of 2020.[231]Activism[edit]Habitat for Humanity– Donor.[232]Human Rights Campaign(HRC) – Corporate partner.[233]National Women\\'s Law Center– Donor.[234]Share Our Strength– Donor.[235]WaterAid– Partner.[236]Conferences and summits[edit]Women in Medicine Summit – Sponsor.[237]World Neuroscience Innovation Forum – Strategic partner.[238]Media[edit]During theCOVID-19 pandemic, Pfizer engaged many forms of media to promote theirCOVID-19 vaccine, including a commissionedNational Geographicdocumentary.[239]Pfizer is also a donor to theNational Geographic Society.[240]Pfizer was a prominent sponsor of the2022 Oscars ceremonyalongsideBioNTech.[241]Pfizer has been a major donor to theNational Press Foundation.[242][243]Pfizer sponsored a program for the NPF called \"Cancer Issues 2010\" to train journalists to \"understand the latest research\" on various cancers, including the role of pharmaceutical products and vaccines.MicroRNA(miRNA) was also a listed topic.[244][245]Pfizer sponsors19 to Zero, a \"coalition of academics, public health experts, behavioural economists, and creative professionals\" that develops media and educational materials to influence public perception surroundingCOVID-19andCOVID-19 vaccines.[246]Medical societies[edit]American Society of Hematology– Sponsor.[247]Arthritis Society – National partner.

Since its founding in 2002, the company has made numerous advancements inrocket propulsion,reusable launch vehicle,human spaceflightandsatellite constellationtechnology. As of 2024[update], SpaceX is the world\\'s dominantspace launchprovider, its launch cadence eclipsing all others, including private competitors and national programs like theChinese space program.[8]SpaceX,NASA, and theUnited States Armed Forceswork closely together by means ofgovernmental contracts.[9]SpaceX was founded byElon Muskin 2002 with a vision of decreasing the costs of space launches, paving the way toa sustainable colony on Mars. In 2008, when SpaceX was almost bankrupt,Falcon 1successfully launched into orbit after three failed launch attempts. The company then pivoted towards the development of the largerFalcon 9rocket and theDragon 1capsule to satisfyNASA\\'sCOTS contractsfor deliveries to theInternational Space Station. By 2012, SpaceX finished all COTS test flights and began deliveringCommercial Resupply Servicesmissions to the International Space Station. Also around that time, SpaceX started developing hardware to make theFalcon 9 first stage reusable. The company demonstrated thefirst successful first-stage landing in 2015andre-launch of the first stage in 2017.Falcon Heavy, built from three Falcon 9 boosters,first flew in 2018after a more than decade-long development process. As of October 2024, the company\\'s Falcon 9 rockets have landed and flown againmore than 330 times, reaching 1–2 launches a week.These milestones delivered the company much-needed investment and SpaceX sought todiversifyits sources of income. In 2019, the first operational satellite of theStarlinkinternetsatellite constellationcame online. In subsequent years, Starlink generated the bulk of SpaceX\\'s income and paved the way for itsStarshieldmilitary counterpart. In 2020, SpaceX began to operate itsDragon 2capsules to deliver crewed missions for NASA and private entities. Around this time, SpaceX began building test prototypes forStarship, which is the largest launch vehicle in history and aims to fully realize the company\\'s vision of a fully-reusable, cost-effective and adaptable launch vehicle. SpaceX is also developing its ownspace suitandastronautvia itsPolaris program[10]as well as developing thehuman lander for lunar missionsunder NASA\\'sArtemis program.[11]SpaceX is not publicly traded; a space industry newspaper estimated that SpaceX has a revenue of over$10 billionin 2024.[12]History[edit]Main article:History of SpaceXSee also:List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches2001–2004: Founding[edit]In early 2001,Elon MuskmetRobert Zubrinand donated$100,000to hisMars Society, joining its board of directors for a short time.[13]:\\u200a30–31He gave aplenary talkat their fourth convention where he announcedMars Oasis, a project to land agreenhouseand grow plants on Mars.[14][15]Musk initially attempted to acquire aDneprlaunch vehicle for the project through Russian contacts fromJim Cantrell.[16]Musk returned with his team to Moscow, this time bringingMichael Griffin, who later became the 11thAdministrator of NASA, but found the Russians increasingly unreceptive.[17][18]On the flight home, Musk announced he could start a company to build the affordable rockets they needed instead.[18]By applyingvertical integration,[17]using inexpensivecommercial off-the-shelfcomponents when possible,[18]and adopting themodular approachof modern software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch costs.[18]In early 2002, Elon Musk started to look for staff for his company, soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached five people for the initial positions at the fledgling company, including Griffin, who declined the position of Chief Engineer,[19]:\\u200a11Jim Cantrelland John Garvey (Cantrell and Garvey would later found the companyVector Launch), rocket engineerTom Mueller, and Chris Thompson.[19][20]SpaceX was first headquartered in a warehouse inEl Segundo, California. Early SpaceX employees, such asTom Mueller(CTO),Gwynne Shotwell(COO), and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations), came from neighboringTRWandBoeingcorporations. By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.[21]Musk personally interviewed and approved all of SpaceX\\'s early employees.[19]:\\u200a22Musk has stated that one of his goals with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access tospace, ultimately by a factor of ten.[22]2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches[edit]Main article:Falcon 1The first successfulFalcon 1launch in September 2008SpaceX developed its firstorbital launch vehicle, theFalcon 1, with internal funding.[23][24]The Falcon 1 was anexpendabletwo-stage-to-orbitsmall-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately$90\\xa0million[25]to$100\\xa0million.[19]:\\u200a215The Falcon rocket series was named afterStar Wars\\'sMillennium Falconfictional spacecraft.[26]In 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to theGovernment Accountability Office(GAO) because of a sole-source contract awarded toKistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could respond, NASA withdrew the contract, and formed theCOTS program.[19]:\\u200a109–110[27]In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program that would later become theDragon spacecraft.[28]In 2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded$396\\xa0millionto provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the International Space Station (ISS) under theCOTS program.[29]The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by theUnited States Department of Defenseunder theDARPA Falcon Projectwhich evaluated new U.S. launch vehicles suitable for use in hypersonic missile delivery forPrompt Global Strike.[24][30][31]The first three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures, which almost ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed, as well,[32]and consequentlyTesla,SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same time.[19]:\\u200a178–182Musk was reportedly \"waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain\" because of the stress.[19]:\\u200a216The financial situation started to turn around with the first successful launch achieved onthe fourth attempton 28 September 2008. Musk split his remaining$30\\xa0millionbetween SpaceX and Tesla, and NASA awarded the firstCommercial Resupply Services(CRS) contract awarding$1.6\\xa0billionto SpaceX in December, thus financially saving the company.[19]:\\u200a217–221Based on these factors and the further business operations they enabled, the Falcon 1 was soon retired following itssecond successful, and fifth total, launchin July 2009. This allowed SpaceX to focus company resources on the development of a larger orbital rocket, the Falcon 9.[33]Gwynne Shotwellwas also promoted to company president at the time, for her role in successfully negotiating the CRS contract with theNASAAssociate AdministratorBill Gerstenmaier.[34][19]:\\u200a2222010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts[edit]Video of the first launch of Falcon 9SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle with an intermediate capacity vehicle, theFalcon 5.[35]The company instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of theFalcon 9, areusableheavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated byNASA, which committed to purchasing several commercial flights if specific capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from theCommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) program in 2006.[36]The overall contract award was$278\\xa0millionto provide development funding for theDragon spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon.[36]As part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with theDragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboardCOTS Demo Flight 1, the Falcon 9\\'s second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits, completing all its mission objectives.[37]By December 2010, the SpaceX production line was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months.[38]In April 2011, as part of its second-roundCommercial Crew Development(CCDev) program, NASA issued a$75\\xa0millioncontract for SpaceX to develop an integratedlaunch escape systemfor Dragon in preparation for human-rating it as a crew transport vehicle to the ISS.[39]NASA awarded SpaceX a fixed-priceSpace Act Agreement(SAA) to produce a detailed design of the crew transportation system in August 2012.[40]In early 2012, approximately two-thirds of SpaceX stock was owned by Musk[41]and his seventy million shares were then estimated to be worth$875\\xa0milliononprivate markets,[42]valuing SpaceX at$1.3\\xa0billion.[43]In May 2012, with theDragon C2+launch, Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to theInternational Space Station.[44]After the flight, the company private equity valuation nearly doubled to$2.4\\xa0billionor$20/share.[45][46]By that time, SpaceX had operated on total funding of approximately$1\\xa0billionover its first decade of operation. Of this, private equity provided approximately$200\\xa0million, with Musk investing approximately$100\\xa0millionand other investors having put in about$100\\xa0million.[47]SpaceX\\'s active reusability test program began in late 2012 with testing low-altitude, low-speed aspects of the landing technology.[48]TheFalcon 9 prototypesperformed vertical takeoffs and landings (VTOL). High-velocity, high-altitude tests of theboosteratmospheric return technology began in late 2013.[48]2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth[edit]Launch of Falcon 9 carryingORBCOMM OG2-M1, July 2014SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014, SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide.[49]That yearArianespacerequested that European governments provide additionalsubsidiesto face the competition from SpaceX.[50][51]Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads, which for nearly a decade had been dominated by the large U.S. launch providerUnited Launch Alliance(ULA).[52]The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise to over$400\\xa0millionover the years.[53]In September 2014, NASA\\'s Director of Commercial Spaceflight, Kevin Crigler, awarded SpaceX the Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six operational missions after certification.[40]In January 2015, SpaceX raised$1\\xa0billionin funding fromGoogleandFidelity Investments, in exchange for 8.33% of the company, establishing the company valuation at approximately$12\\xa0billion.[54]The same month SpaceX announced the development of a new satellite constellation, calledStarlink, to provide global broadband internet service with 4,000 satellites.[55]The Falcon 9 had its first major failure in late June 2015, when the seventh ISS resupply mission,CRS-7exploded two minutes into the flight. The problem was traced to a failed two-foot-long steel strut that held aheliumpressure vessel, which broke free due to the force ofacceleration. This caused a breach and allowed high-pressure helium to escape into the low-pressurepropellant tank, causing the failure.[56]2015–2017: Reusability milestones[edit]Falcon 9 first stage on anautonomous spaceport drone ship(ASDS)bargeafter the first successful landing at sea,SpaceX CRS-8missionSpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December 2015 withFalcon 9 Flight 20.[57]In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS)Of Course I Still Love Youin the Atlantic Ocean.[58]By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9 first stage.[59]A second major rocket failure happened in early September 2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launchstatic fire test. The payload, theAMOS-6communications satellite valued at$200\\xa0million, was destroyed.[60]The explosion was caused by theliquid oxygenthat is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited withcarbon compositehelium vessels.[61]Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.[62]In March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for theSES-10satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.[63]The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket.[64]2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider[edit]In July 2017, the company raised$350\\xa0million, which raised its valuation to$21\\xa0billion.[65]In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.[66]By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about$12\\xa0billionin contract revenue.[67]The contracts included both commercial andgovernment(NASA/DOD) customers.[68]This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.[69]In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary,The Boring Company,[70]and began work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility, using a small number of SpaceX employees,[71]which was completed in May 2018,[72]and opened to the public in December 2018.[73]During 2018, The Boring Company wasspun outinto a separatecorporate entitywith 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.[73]Since 2019: Starship, first crewed launches, Starlink and general[edit]In 2019 SpaceX raised$1.33\\xa0billionof capital across three funding rounds.[74]By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to$33.3\\xa0billion[75]and reached$36\\xa0billionby March 2020.[76]On 19 August 2020, after a$1.9\\xa0billionfunding round, one of the largest single fundraising pushes by any privately held company, SpaceX\\'s valuation increased to$46\\xa0billion.[77][78][79]In February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional$1.61\\xa0billionin an equity round from 99 investors[80]at a per share value of approximately$420,[79]raising the company valuation to approximately$74\\xa0billion. By 2021, SpaceX had raised more than$6\\xa0billionin equity financing. Most of the capital raised since 2019 has been used to support the operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the development and manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle.[80]By October 2021, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to$100.3\\xa0billion.[81]On 16 April 2021, Starship HLS won a contract to play a critical role in the NASA crewed spaceflightArtemis program.[82]By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements withGoogle Cloud PlatformandMicrosoft Azureto provide on-ground computer and networking services forStarlink.[83]A new round of financing in 2022 valued SpaceX at$127\\xa0billion.[84]In July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship namedA Shortfall of Gravitas, landing a booster fromCRS-23on it for the first time on 29 August 2021.[85]Within the first 130 days of 2022, SpaceX had 18 rocket launches and two astronaut splashdowns. On 13 December 2021, company CEOElon Muskannounced that the company was starting acarbon dioxide removalprogram that wouldconvert captured carbonintorocket fuel,[86][87]after he announced a$100\\xa0milliondonation to theX Prize Foundationthe previous February to provide the monetary rewards to winners in a contest to develop the bestcarbon capture technology.[88][89]In August 2022,Reutersreported that theEuropean Space Agency(ESA) began initial discussions with SpaceX that could lead to the company\\'s launchers being used temporarily, given that Russia blocked access toSoyuzrockets amid theRussian invasion of Ukraine.[90]Since that invasion and in the greater war between Russia and Ukraine, Starlinkwas extensively used.[91]In 2022, SpaceX\\'s Falcon 9 also became the world record holder for the most launches of a single vehicle type in a single year.[92][93][non-primary source needed]SpaceX launched a rocket approximately every six days in 2022, with 61 launches in total. All but one (a Falcon Heavy in November) was on a Falcon 9 rocket.[92]In November 2023, SpaceX announced it would acquire its parachute supplierPioneer Aerospaceout of bankruptcy for$2.2 million.[94][95]2024 headquarters move from California to Texas[edit]Main article:SAFETY Act (California law) §\\xa0Elon MuskOn 16 July 2024, Elon Musk posted onXthat SpaceX would move its headquarters fromHawthorne, California, toSpaceX StarbaseinBrownsville, Texas. Musk said this was because the recently passed CaliforniaAB1955 bill\"and the many others that preceded it, attacking both families and companies\".[96]This new law in California bans school districts from requiring that teachers notify parents about changes to a student\\'s sexual orientation and gender identity.[97]The headquarters officially moved toBrownsville, Texasin August 2024, according to records filed with the California Secretary of State.[98]The move to relocate SpaceX\\'s headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term. The Hawthorne facility continues to support the company\\'s Falcon launch vehicles, which was SpaceX\\'s workhorse product in 2024.SpaceX\\'sPolaris Dawnmission featured the first-ever private spacewalk, marking a major milestone in commercial space exploration.[99]Starship[edit]Starship in launch positionIn January 2019, SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce to help finance theStarshipandStarlinkprojects.[100]The purpose of the Starship vehicle is to enable large-scale transit of humans and cargo to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.[101]SpaceX\\'s Starship is the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown, with a payload capacity of 100+ tons.[102][103]Construction of initial prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction and testing moved to the newSpaceX South Texas launch sitelater that year.On 20 April 2023, Starship\\'sfirst orbital flight testended in a mid-air explosion over theGulf of Mexicobefore booster separation. After launch, multiple engines in the booster progressively failed, causing the vehicle to reachmaxqlater than planned. \"Max q\" is the theoretical point of maximal mechanical stress which occurs during the launch sequence of a space vehicle. In the case of a rocket that must be self-destructed during its ascent, max q occurs at the point of self-destruction. Eventually, the vehicle lost control and spun erratically until the automatedflight termination systemwas activated, which intentionally destroyed the rocket. Elon Musk, SpaceX, and other individuals familiar with the space industry have referred to the test flight as a success.[104][105]Musk said at the time that it would take \"six to eight weeks\" to get the infrastructure prepared for another launch. In October 2023, a senior SpaceX executive stated the company had been ready to launch the next test flight since September. He accused government regulators of disrupting the project\\'s progress, adding the delay could lead to China beating U.S. astronauts back to the Moon.[106][107]On 18 November 2023, SpaceX launched Starship on itssecond flight test, with both vehicles flying for a few minutes before separately exploding.[108][109][110][111]In early March 2024 SpaceX announced that it was targeting 14 March as the tentative launch date for its next uncrewed Starship launch configuration flight test, pending the issuance of a \"launch license\" by theFAA. This license was granted on 13 March 2024.[112]On 14 March 2024 at 13:25 UTC, Starship launched for the 3rd time and for the first time Starship reached its planned suborbital trajectory. The flight ended with the booster experiencing a malfunction shortly before landing and the ship being lost during reentry over the Indian Ocean.[102][103]On 4 June 2024, SpaceX received the launch license for Starship\\'s 4th test flight. The licensure itself was notable in that it was the first time that the FAA included a clause that would allow SpaceX to launch subsequent test flights without a mishap investigation, provided that they met a similar launch profile and used the same specification of hardware. The provision could prove to speed the development timeline.[113]On 12 October 2024, SpaceX received FAA approval for Starship\\'s 5th test flight.[114]The flight was the first without engine failures, and the first successful tower catch.[115]SpaceX launched Starship on its 6th test flight on 19 November 2024.[116]The booster aborted the catch attempt, while the ship conducted a relight in space.[117][118]Crewed launches[edit]NASA astronauts Douglas Hurley (left) and Robert Behnken (right) wearing custom-fit spacesuits designed by SpaceX.A significant milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA astronauts (Doug HurleyandBob Behnken) into orbit on aCrew Dragonspacecraft duringCrew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years.[119][120]The mission launched fromKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A(LC-39A) in Florida.[121]Starlink[edit]In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning to deploy what would become the world\\'s largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.[122]In 2022, most SpaceX launches focused on Starlink, a consumer internet business that sends batches of internet-beaming satellites and now has over 6,000 satellites in orbit.[123]On 16 July 2021, SpaceX entered an agreement to acquireSwarm Technologies, a private company building alow Earth orbitsatellite constellation for communications withInternet of things(IoT) devices, for$524\\xa0million.[124][4]In December 2022, the U.S.Federal Communications Commission(FCC) approved the launch of up to 7,500 of SpaceX\\'s next-generation satellites in its Starlink internet network.[125]Summary of achievements[edit]DateAchievementFlight28 September 2008First privately funded, fully liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.[126]Falcon 1 Flight 414 July 2009First privately funded, fully liquid-fueled rocket to put a commercial satellite in orbit.Falcon 1 Flight 59 December 2010First private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 125 May 2012First private company to send a spacecraft to theInternational Space Station(ISS).[127]SpaceX COTS Demo Flight 222 December 2015First landing of an orbital-class rocket\\'s first stage on land.Falcon 9 Flight 208 April 2016First landing of an orbital-class rocket\\'s first stage on an ocean platform.SpaceX CRS-830 March 2017First reuse and (second) landing of an orbital first stage.[63]SES-10First controlled flyback and recovery of a payload fairing.[128]3 June 2017First reuse of a commercial cargo spacecraft.[129]SpaceX CRS-116 February 2018Firstprivate spacecraftlaunched intoheliocentric orbit.Falcon Heavy test flight2 March 2019First private company to send a human-rated spacecraft to orbit.Crew Dragon Demo-13 March 2019First private company to autonomously dock a human-rated spacecraft to the ISS.25 July 2019First flight of afull-flow staged combustion cycleengine (Raptor).[130]Starhopper11 November 2019First reuse of a payload fairing.[131]Starlink 2 v1.030 May 2020First private company to send humans into orbit.[132]Crew Dragon Demo-2First private company to send humans to the ISS.[133]24 January 2021Most spacecraft launched on a single mission, 143 satellites.[a][134]Transporter-123 April 2021First reuse of a crewedspace capsule.[135]SpaceX Crew-2/EndeavourFirst reused booster to send humans into orbit.17 June 2021First reused booster to launch a \\'national security\\' mission.[136]GPS III-0516 September 2021First orbital launch of an all-private crew.[137][138]Inspiration424 November 2021Longest streak of orbital launches without a mission failure or partial failure for a single rocket type (Falcon 9, 101 launches).[139]Double Asteroid Redirection Test9 April 2022First all-private crew to dock with theInternational Space Station.[140]Axiom Mission 120 October 2022Highest number of launches of a single rocket type in a calendar year (Falcon 9, 48 launches).[141]Starlink 4-3620 April 2023Tallest, most massive, most powerful rocket to ever launch.[142][143]SpaceX Starship orbital test flight14 March 2024Starship reaches intended orbital velocity for the first time.[144]SpaceX Starship integrated flight test 312 April 2024A single Falcon 9 booster reused for the 20th time.[145]Booster 106212 September 2024First commercial spacewalkPolaris Dawn13 October 2024First Super Heavy booster catchStarship flight test 519 November 2024First in space relight of afull-flow staged combustion cycleengine (Raptor).[146]Starship flight test 6^Excluding the passive objects launched as part ofProject West FordHardware[edit]Launch vehicles[edit]Main article:SpaceX launch vehiclesThe landing of aFalcon 9 Block 5first stage at Cape Canaveral in July 2019.VTVLtechnologies are used in many of SpaceX\\'s launch vehicles.SpaceX has developed three launch vehicles. The small-liftFalcon 1was the first launch vehicle developed and was retired in 2009. The medium-liftFalcon 9and the heavy-liftFalcon Heavyare both operational.Falcon 1was a small rocket capable of placing several hundred kilograms intolow Earth orbit. It launched five times between 2006 and 2009, of which two were successful.[147]The Falcon 1 was the first privately funded, liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit.[126]Falcon 9is amedium-lift launch vehiclecapable of delivering up to 22,800 kilograms (50,265lb) to orbit, competing with theDelta IVand theAtlas Vrockets, as well as other launch providers around the world. It has nineMerlinengines in its first stage. TheFalcon 9 v1.0rocket successfully reached orbit on its first attempt on 4 June 2010. Its third flight,COTS Demo Flight 2, launched on 22 May 2012 and launched the firstcommercialspacecraft to reach and dock with the International Space Station (ISS).[44]The vehicle was upgraded toFalcon 9 v1.1in 2013,Falcon 9 Full Thrustin 2015, and finally toFalcon 9 Block 5in 2018. The first stage of Falcon 9 is designed to retro propulsively land, be recovered, and flown again.[148]Falcon Heavyis aheavy-lift launch vehiclecapable of delivering up to 63,800kg (140,700lb) toLow Earth orbit(LEO) or 26,700kg (58,900lb) togeosynchronous transfer orbit(GTO). It uses three slightly modified Falcon 9 first-stage cores with a total of 27Merlin 1Dengines.[149][150]The Falcon Heavy successfully flew its inaugural mission on 6 February 2018, launching Musk\\'s personalTesla Roadsterintoheliocentric orbit[151]Both the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are certified to conduct launches for theNational Security Space Launch(NSSL).[152][153]As of 15 January 2025, the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have been launched 439 times, resulting in 436 full mission successes, one partial success, andone in-flight failure. In addition, a Falcon 9 experienceda pre-flight failurebefore a static fire test in 2016.[154][155]SpaceX is developing a fully reusable super-heavy lift launch system known asStarship. It comprises a reusable first stage, calledSuper Heavy, and the reusableStarship second stagespace vehicle. As of 2017[update], the system was intended to supersede the company\\'s existing launch vehicle hardware by the early 2020s.[156][157]Rocket engines[edit]Main article:SpaceX rocket enginesMerlin 1D engineundergoes a test at SpaceX\\'s Rocket Development and Test Facility inMcGregor, TexasSince the founding of SpaceX in 2002, the company has developed severalrocket engines–Merlin,Kestrel, andRaptor– for use inlaunch vehicles,[158][159]Dracofor thereaction control systemof the Dragon series of spacecraft,[160]andSuperDracofor abort capability inCrew Dragon.[161]Merlin is a family of rocket engines that usesliquid oxygen(LOX) andRP-1propellants. Merlin was first used to power the Falcon 1\\'s first stage and is now used on both stages of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles.[162]Kestrel uses the same propellants and was used as the Falcon 1 rocket\\'s second-stage main engine.[159][163]Draco andSuperDracoarehypergolicliquid-propellant rocket engines. Draco engines are used on thereaction control systemof theDragonandDragon 2spacecraft.[160]TheSuperDracoengine is more powerful, and eight SuperDraco engines providelaunch escape capabilityfor crewed Dragon 2 spacecraft during an abort scenario.[164]Raptor is a new family of liquid oxygen and liquidmethane-fueledfull-flow staged combustion cycleengines to power the first and second stages of the in-developmentStarshiplaunch system.[158]Development versions were test-fired in late 2016,[165]and the engine flew for the first time in 2019, powering theStarhoppervehicle to an altitude of 20\\xa0m (66\\xa0ft).[166]Dragon spacecraft[edit]Main articles:Dragon 1andDragon 2SpaceX Dragon 2spacecraft, designed to deliver crew and cargo to and from the International Space Station (cargo version shown)SpaceX has developed the Dragon spacecraft to transport cargo and crew to the International Space Station (ISS).The first-generationDragon 1spacecraft was used only for cargo operations. It was developed with financial support from NASA under theCommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) program. After a successful COTS demonstration flight in 2010, SpaceX was chosen to receive aCommercial Resupply Services(CRS) contract.[37]The currently operational second-generationDragon 2spacecraft conductedits first flight, without crew, to the ISS in early 2019, followed bya crewed flightof Dragon 2 in 2020.[119]It was developed with financial support from NASA under theCommercial Crew Programprogram. Thecargo variant of Dragon 2flew for the first time in December 2020, for a resupply to the ISS as part of the CRS contract with NASA.[167]In March 2020 SpaceX revealed the Dragon XL, designed as a resupply spacecraft for NASA\\'s plannedLunar Gatewayspace station under aGateway Logistics Services(GLS) contract.[168]Dragon XL is planned to launch on theFalcon Heavy, and is able to transport over 5,000\\xa0kg (11,000\\xa0lb) to the Gateway. Dragon XL will be docked at the Gateway for six to twelve months at a time.[169]SpaceX designed a spacesuitto be worn inside the Dragon spacecraft to protect from possible depressurization.[170]On 4 May 2024, SpaceX unveiled a second spacesuit designed forextravehicular activity, planned to be used for aspacewalkduring thePolaris Dawnmission.[171]Autonomous spaceport drone ships[edit]Main articles:SpaceX reusable launch system development program,Falcon 9 first-stage landing tests, andAutonomous spaceport drone shipAutonomous spaceport drone shipin position prior toCRS-6missionSpaceX routinely returns thefirst stageof Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets after orbital launches. The rocket lands at a predetermined landing site using only its propulsion systems.[172]When propellant margins do not permit a return to a launch site (RTLS), rockets return to a floating landing platform in the ocean, calledautonomous spaceport drone ships(ASDS).[173]SpaceX also had plans to introducefloating launch platforms, which would be modified oil rigs provide a sea launch option for theirStarshiplaunch vehicle. As of February 2023, SpaceX had sold the oil rigs, but had not ruled out sea-based platforms for future use.[174]Starlink[edit]Main article:StarlinkSixty Starlink satellites stacked together before deploymentStarlink is an internet satellite constellation under development by Starlink Services, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceX,[7][175]that consists of thousands of cross-linkedcommunications satellitesin ~550km orbits. Its goal is to address the significant unmet demand worldwide for low-cost broadband capabilities.[176]Development began in 2015, and initial prototype test-flight satellites were launched on the SpaceXPaz satellitemission in 2017. In May 2019, SpaceX launched the first batch of 60 satellites aboard a Falcon 9.[177]Initial test operation of the constellation began in late 2020[178]and first orders were taken in early 2021.[179]Customers were told to expect internet service speeds of 50\\xa0Mbit/s to 150\\xa0Mbit/s and latency from 20 ms to 40 ms.[180]In December 2022, Starlink reached over 1 million subscribers worldwide.[181]The planned large number ofStarlinksatellites has been criticized by astronomers due to concerns overlight pollution,[182][183][184]with the brightness of Starlink satellites in both optical and radio wavelengths interfering with scientific observations.[185]In response, SpaceX has implemented several upgrades to Starlink satellites aimed at reducing their brightness.[186]The large number of satellites employed by Starlink also creates long-term dangers ofspace debris collisions.[187][188]However, the satellites are equipped withkrypton-fueledHall thrusterswhich allow them tode-orbitat the end of their life. They are also designed to autonomously avoid collisions based on uplinked tracking data.[189]In December 2022, SpaceX announcedStarshield, a program to incorporate military or government entity payloads on board a Starlink-derived satellite bus. TheSpace Development Agencyis a key customer procuring satellites for a space-basedmissile defensesystem.[190][191]In June 2024, SpaceX introduced a compact version of its Starlink antennas, the \"Starlink Mini\", designed for mobile satellite internet use. Offered for$599in an early access release, it was more expensive than the base model. The Mini antenna, half the size and one-third the weight of the Standard version, featured a built-inWiFi router, lower power consumption, and over 100 Mbit/s download speeds.[192]Other projects[edit]Main article:Hyperloop pod competitionHyperloop[edit]In June 2015, SpaceX announced that it would sponsor aHyperloop competition, and would build a 1.6\\xa0km (0.99\\xa0mi) longsubscaletest track near SpaceX\\'s headquarters for the competitive events.[193][194]The company held the annual competition from 2017 to 2019.[195]COVID-19 antibody-testing program[edit]In collaboration with doctors and academic researchers, SpaceX invited all employees to participate in the creation of aCOVID-19antibody-testing program in 2020. As such, 4300 employees volunteered to provide blood samples resulting in apeer-reviewedscientific paper crediting eight SpaceX employees as coauthors and suggesting that a certain level of COVID-19 antibodies may provide lasting protection against the virus.[196][197]Other[edit]In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build amini-submarineto assist therescue of children stuck in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[198]Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton later concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk\\'s involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[199][200]Engineers at SpaceX andThe Boring Companybuilt the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9liquid oxygentransfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[201][202]Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn\\'t practical for the rescue mission.[198]Facilities[edit]SpaceX is headquartered at theSpaceX StarbasenearBrownsville, Texas, where it manufactures and launches its Starship vehicle. However most of the company\\'s operations are based out of its office inHawthorne, Californiawhere it was previously headquartered, where it builds Falcon rockets and Dragon spacecraft, and where it houses its mission control.The company also operates a Starlink satellite manufacturing facilities in Redmond, Washington, arocket development and test facilityinMcGregor, Texas,[203]and maintains an office in the Washington, D.C. area, close to key government customers.[204]SpaceX has two active launch sites in Florida, one active launch site in California and one active launch site at Starbase in Texas.Hawthorne, CA: Falcon and Dragon manufacturing, mission control[edit]SpaceX office in Hawthorne, California at night during a Falcon 9 launch fromVandenberg Space Force BaseSpaceX operates a large facility in the Los Angeles suburb ofHawthorne, California. The three-story building, originally built byNorthrop Corporationto buildBoeing 747fuselages,[205]houses SpaceX\\'s office space, mission control, and Falcon 9 manufacturing facilities.[206]The area has one of the largest concentrations of space sector headquarters, facilities, and subsidiaries in the U.S., includingBoeing/McDonnell Douglasmain satellite building campuses,The Aerospace Corporation,Raytheon, NASA\\'sJet Propulsion Laboratory,United States Space Force\\'sSpace Systems CommandatLos Angeles Air Force Base,Lockheed Martin,BAE Systems,Northrop Grumman, andAECOM, etc., with a large pool of aerospace engineers and recent college engineering graduates.[205]SpaceX uses a high degree ofvertical integrationin the production of its rockets and rocket engines.[17]SpaceX builds itsrocket engines,rocket stages,spacecraft, principalavionicsand allsoftwarein-house in their Hawthorne facility, which is unusual for the space industry.[17]The Hawthorne facility was SpaceX\\'s headquarters until August 2024. However, the move to relocate SpaceX\\'s headquarters was seen as largely symbolic, at least in the short term, as the facility will remain to the company\\'s operations.[207]Boca Chica, TX: Starship manufacturing, launch[edit]Main article:SpaceX StarbaseThe Starship assembly building atSpaceX Starbasein TexasSpaceX manufactures and flies Starship test vehicles from theSpaceX StarbaseinBoca ChicanearBrownsville, Texas, having announced first plans for the launch facility in August 2014.[208][209]TheFederal Aviation Administration(FAA) issued the permit in July 2014.[210]SpaceX broke ground on the new launch facility in 2014 with construction ramping up in the latter half of 2015,[211]with the firstsuborbitallaunches from the facility in 2019[206]and orbital launches starting in 2023.SpaceX has faced increased scrutiny over the environmental impact of its Starbase facility.[212][213][214]In August 2024, theTexas Commission on Environmental Qualitycited SpaceX for violating environmental regulations by repeatedly releasing pollutants into water near the Boca Chica launch site.[215]TheEPAfined SpaceX approximately$150,000for allegedly discharging \"industrial wastewater\" and violating theClean Water Act.[216]McGregor, TX: Rocket Development and Test Facility[edit]Main article:SpaceX Rocket Development and Test FacilityAerial view of the SpaceX McGregor engine testing facility, 2008SpaceX\\'s Rocket Development and Test Facility inMcGregor, Texasis arocket engine test facility. Every rocket engine and thruster manufactured by SpaceX must pass through McGregor for final testing being used on flight missions.[217][218]The facility also serves as a testing ground for various components and engines during theresearch and developmentprocess.[219]In addition to engine testing, after splashdown and recovery,Dragon spacecraftmake a stop at McGregor to have their hazardoushypergolic propellantfuels removed, before the capsules continue on to Hawthorne for refurbishment.[217]SpaceX calls the facility the most advanced and active rocket engine test facility in the world, and said that as of 2024[update], over 7,000 tests had been conducted at the facility since it opened, with seven engine test fires on a typical day, across more than a dozen test stands.[220]Despite its low-profile compared to the company\\'s other facilities, is a critical part of SpaceX\\'s operations, and company president and COOGwynne Shotwellmaintains her primary office in McGregor.[221][217]Originally the site of theBluebonnet Ordnance Plantduring World War II,[219]the facility was later used byBeal Aerospacebefore being leased by SpaceX in 2003.[222]The company has since expanded it significantly from 256 acres (104\\xa0ha) in 2003[219]to 4,000 acres (1,600\\xa0ha) by 2015.[220]In July 2021, SpaceX announced plans to build a second production facility for Raptor engines at McGregor. This expansion is expected to significantly increase SpaceX\\'s production capacity, with the goal of producing 800 to 1,000 Raptor engines per year.[223][224]Starlink manufacturing facilities[edit]Starlink user terminal on the sidewalk of a residential home.SpaceX\\'sStarlinksubsidiary operates over two main facilities. Satellite manufacturing takes place nearSeattle, Washington while user terminal manufacturing takes place nearAustin, Texas.Starlink\\'s satellite development and manufacturing operations campus occupies over 314,000 square feet (29,200\\xa0m2) in at least six buildings located inRedmond, Washington, east of Seattle. The first building opened in early 2015,[225]and the company later expanded into five buildings on the Redmond Ridge Corporate Center.[226][227]Starlink opened a user terminal manufacturing facility inBastrop, Texas, east of Austin in December 2023. In its first nine months of operation, the one-million-square-foot (93,000\\xa0m2) facility produced one million user terminals and was on track to become the largest factory forprinted circuit boardsin the United States.[228]Launch facilities[edit]Main article:SpaceX launch facilitiesFalcon Heavy Side Boosters landing onLZ1and LZ2 at Cape CanaveralSpaceX operates fourorbitallaunch sites, atCape Canaveral Space Force StationandKennedy Space Centerin Florida andVandenberg Space Force Basein California for Falcon rockets, andStarbasenearBrownsville, Texasfor Starship. SpaceX has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad.[229]The Vandenberg launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral and Kennedy enable orbits of medium inclination (28.5–55°).[230]Larger inclinations, includingSSO, are possible from Florida by overflying Cuba.[231]Before it was retired, allFalcon 1launches took place at theRonald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test SiteonOmelek Islandof theMarshall Islands.[232]In April 2007,the Pentagonapproved the use ofCape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 40(SLC-40) by SpaceX.[233]The site has been used since 2010 for Falcon 9 launches, mainly to low Earth and geostationary orbits. The formerLaunch Complex 13at Cape Canaveral, now renamedLanding Zones 1 and 2, has since 2015 been used for Falcon 9first-stage booster landings.[234]SpaceX west coast launch facility atVandenberg Space Force Base, during the launch ofCASSIOPEVandenberg Space Launch Complex 4(SLC-4E) was leased from the military in 2011 and is used for payloads to polar orbits. The Vandenberg site can launch both Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles,[235]but cannot launch to low inclination orbits. The neighboring SLC-4W was converted toLanding Zone 4in 2015 for booster landings.[236]On 14 April 2014, SpaceX signed a 20-year lease forKennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A.[237]The pad was subsequently modified to supportFalcon 9andFalcon Heavylaunches. As of 2024[update]it is the only pad that supports Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launched itsfirst crewed missionto the ISS from Launch Pad 39A on 30 May 2020.[238]Pad 39A has been prepared since 2019 to eventually accommodate Starship launches. With delays in launch FAA permits for Boca Chica, Texas, the 39A Starship preparation was accelerated in 2022.[239]Contracts[edit]Further information on SpaceX launches:Falcon 1 §\\xa0Launches,List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches, andList of Starship launchesSpaceX won demonstration and actual supply contracts fromNASAfor the International Space Station (ISS) with technology the company developed. SpaceX is also certified forU.S. militarylaunches ofEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle-class (EELV) payloads. With approximately thirty missions on the manifest for 2018 alone, SpaceX represented over$12\\xa0billionunder contract.[68]Cargo to ISS[edit]Main articles:Commercial Orbital Transportation Services,Commercial Resupply Services, andGateway Logistics ServicesThe COTS 2 Dragon is berthed to theInternational Space Station(ISS) byCanadarm2In 2006, SpaceX won a NASACommercial Orbital Transportation Services(COTS) Phase 1 contract to demonstrate cargo delivery to the ISS, with a possible contract option for crew transport.[240]Through this contract, designed by NASA to provide \"seed money\" through Space Act Agreements for developing new capabilities, NASA paid SpaceX$396\\xa0millionto develop the cargo configuration of the Dragon spacecraft, while SpaceX developed the Falcon 9 launch vehicle with their resources.[241]TheseSpace Act Agreementshave been shown to have saved NASA millions of dollars in development costs, making rocket development 4–10 times less expensive than if produced by NASA alone.[242]In December 2010, with the launch of theSpaceX COTS Demo Flight 1mission, SpaceX became the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft.[243]Dragon successfully berthed with the ISS duringSpaceX COTS Demo Flight 2in May 2012, a first for aprivate spacecraft.[244]Commercial Resupply Services(CRS) is a series of contracts awarded by NASA from 2008 to 2016 for the delivery of cargo and supplies to the ISS on commercially operated spacecraft. The first CRS contracts were signed in 2008 and awarded$1.6\\xa0billionto SpaceX for 12 cargo transport missions, covering deliveries to 2016.[245]SpaceX CRS-1, the first of the 12 planned resupply missions, launched in October 2012, achieved orbit, berthed, and remained on station for 20 days, beforere-entering the atmosphereand splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.[246]CRS missions have flown approximately twice a year to the ISS since then. In 2015, NASA extended the Phase 1 contracts by ordering an additional three resupply flights from SpaceX, and then extended the contract further for a total of twenty cargo missions to the ISS.[247][245][248]The final Dragon 1 mission,SpaceX CRS-20, departed the ISS in April 2020, andDragonwas subsequently retired from service. Asecond phaseof contracts was awarded in January 2016 with SpaceX as one of the awardees. SpaceX will fly up to nine additional CRS flights with the upgradedDragon 2spacecraft.[249][250]In March 2020, NASA contracted SpaceX to develop theDragon XLspacecraft to send supplies to theLunar Gatewayspace station. Dragon XL will be launched on a Falcon Heavy.[251]Crewed[edit]See also:Commercial Crew ProgramNASA astronauts inside the Dragon spacecraft during theCrew-1 missionrendezvous with the International Space StationSpaceX is responsible for the transportation of NASA astronauts to and from the ISS. The NASA contracts started as part of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, aimed at developing commercially operated spacecraft capable of delivering astronauts to the ISS. The first contract was awarded to SpaceX in 2011,[252][253]followed by another in 2012 to continue development and testing of itsDragon 2spacecraft.[254]In September 2014, NASA chose SpaceX and Boeing as the two companies that would be funded to develop systems to transport U.S. crews to and from the ISS.[255]SpaceX won$2.6\\xa0billionto complete and certify Dragon 2 by 2017. The contracts called for at least one crewed flight test with at least one NASA astronaut aboard. Once Crew Dragon received NASA human-spaceflight certification, the contract required SpaceX to conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station.[255]SpaceX completed the first key flight test of its Crew Dragon spacecraft, aPad Abort Test, in May 2015,[256]and successfully conducted a full uncrewed test flight in early 2019. The capsule docked to the ISS and then splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean.[257]In January 2020, SpaceX conducted anin-flight abort test, the last test flight before flying crew, in which the Dragon spacecraft fired its launch escape engines in a simulated abort scenario.[258]On 30 May 2020, theCrew Dragon Demo-2mission was launched to theInternational Space Stationwith NASA astronautsBob BehnkenandDoug Hurley, the first time a crewed vehicle had launched from the U.S. since 2011, and the first SpaceX commercial crewed launch to the ISS.[259]TheCrew-1mission was successfully launched to the International Space Station on 16 November 2020, withNASAastronautsMichael Hopkins,Victor GloverandShannon Walkeralong withJAXAastronautSoichi Noguchi,[260]all members of theExpedition 64crew.[261]On 23 April 2021,Crew-2was launched to the International Space Station with NASA astronautsShane KimbroughandK. Megan McArthur, JAXA astronautAkihiko Hoshide, andESAastronautThomas Pesquet.[262]The Crew-2 mission successfully docked on 24 April 2021.[263]Resilienceafter splashdownSpaceX also offers paidcrewed spaceflightsfor private individuals. The first of these missions,Inspiration4, launched in 2021 on behalf ofShift4 PaymentsCEOJared Isaacman. The mission launched theCrew DragonResiliencefrom the FloridaKennedy Space Center\\'sLaunch Complex 39Aatop aFalcon 9launch vehicle, placed the Dragoncapsuleintolow Earth orbit, and ended successfully about three days later when theResiliencesplashed down in the Atlantic Ocean. All four crew members received commercial astronaut training from SpaceX. The training included lessons in orbital mechanics, operating in a microgravity environment, stress testing, emergency-preparedness training, and mission simulations.[264]National defense[edit]Launch of theSTP-2mission on a Falcon Heavy in June 2019In 2005, SpaceX announced that it had been awarded anIndefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity(IDIQ) contract, allowing theUnited States Air Forceto purchase up to$100\\xa0millionworth of launches from the company.[265]Three years later,NASAannounced that it had awarded an IDIQ Launch Services contract to SpaceX for up to$1\\xa0billion, depending on the number of missions awarded.[266]In December 2012, SpaceX announced its first two launch contracts with theUnited States Department of Defense(DoD). The United States Air ForceSpace and Missile Systems Centerawarded SpaceX two EELV-class missions:Deep Space Climate Observatory(DSCOVR) andSpace Test Program 2(STP-2). DSCOVR was launched on aFalcon 9launch vehicle in 2015, while STP-2 was launched on aFalcon Heavyon 25 June 2019.[267]TheFalcon 9 v1.1was certified forNational Security Space Launch(NSSL) in 2015, allowing SpaceX to contract launch services to the Air Force for any payloads classified under national security.[152]This broke the monopoly held since 2006 byUnited Launch Alliance(ULA) over U.S. Air Force launches of classified payloads.[268]In April 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded the first such national security launch to SpaceX to launch the secondGPS IIIsatellite for$82.7\\xa0million.[269]This was approximately 40% less than the estimated cost for similar previous missions.[270]SpaceX also launched the third GPS III launch on 20 June 2020.[271]In March 2018, SpaceX secured an additional$290\\xa0millioncontract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three GPS III satellites.[272]The U.S.National Reconnaissance Office(NRO) also purchased launches from SpaceX, with the first taking place on 1 May 2017.[273]In February 2019, SpaceX secured a$297\\xa0millioncontract from the U.S. Air Force to launch another three national security missions, all slated to launch no earlier than FY 2021.[274]In August 2020, theU.S. Space Forceawarded its National Security Space Launch (NSSL) contracts for the following 5–7 years. SpaceX won a contract for$316\\xa0millionfor one launch. In addition, SpaceX will handle 40% of the U.S. military\\'s satellite launch requirements over the period.[275]SpaceX also designs and launchescustom military satellitesfor theSpace Development Agencyas part of a new missile defense system in low Earth orbit.[276]The constellation would give the United States capabilities to sense, target and potentially intercept nuclear missiles and hypersonic weapons launched from anywhere on Earth.[277]Both China and Russia brought concerns to the United Nations about the program,[278]and various organizations warn it could be destabilizing and trigger anarms racein space.[279][280]In March 2024, Reuters reported that, as part of a$1.8 billioncontract signed with the National Reconnaissance Office in 2021, SpaceX is building a network of hundreds ofspy satellites. This new network, Reuters reported, would be able to operate as a swarm in low orbits.[281]In December 2024, WSJ reported that Musk didn\\'t have access to government secrets.[282]Launch market competition and pricing pressure[edit]Main article:Space launch market competitionSpaceX\\'s low launch prices, especially forcommunications satellitesflying togeostationary transfer orbit(GTO), have resulted in market pressure on its competitors to lower their own prices.[17]Prior to 2013, the openly competed comsat launch market had been dominated by Arianespace (flying theAriane 5) andInternational Launch Services(flying theProton).[283]With a published price of$56.5\\xa0millionper launch tolow Earth orbit, Falcon 9 rockets were the least expensive in the industry.[284]European satellite operators are pushing the ESA to reduce launch prices of theAriane 5andAriane 6rockets as a result of competition from SpaceX.[285]SpaceX ended the United Launch Alliance (ULA) monopoly of U.S. military payloads when it began to compete for national security launches. In 2015, anticipating a slump in domestic, military, and spy launches, ULA stated that it would go out of business unless it won commercial satellite launch orders.[286]To that end, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to decrease launch costs by half.[287][288]Congressional testimony by SpaceX in 2017 suggested that the NASASpace Act Agreementprocess of \"setting only a high-level requirement for cargo transport to the space station [while] leaving the details to industry\" had allowed SpaceX to design and develop the Falcon 9 rocket on its own at a substantially lower cost. According to NASA\\'s own independently verified numbers, SpaceX\\'s total development cost for the Falcon 9 rocket, including the Falcon 1 rocket, was estimated at$390\\xa0million. In 2011, NASA estimated that it would have cost the agency about$4\\xa0billionto develop a rocket like the Falcon 9 booster based upon NASA\\'s traditional contracting processes, about ten times more.[242]In May 2020, NASA administratorJim Bridenstineremarked that thanks to NASA\\'s investments into SpaceX, the United States has 70% of the commercial launch market, a major improvement since 2012 when there were no commercial launches from the country.[289]As of 2024, SpaceX operates a Rideshare and Bandwagon (mid inclination) programs. This provides additional competition for small satellite launchers.[290]Corporate affairs[edit]Business trends[edit]YearRevenue(billion USD)Valuation(billion USD)Number of employees2002ca. 30[291]200320042005ca. 90(Feb.)[292]ca. 160(Nov.)[293]20062007ca. 350(Aug.)[294]2008ca. 600(Dec.)[295]2009> 800(Dec.)[296]2010> 1,000(June)[297]2011ca. 1,300(Jan.)[298]20122.4(June)[299]ca. 1,800(May)[300]2013ca. 3,800(Oct.)[301]201410(Aug.)[302]201512(Jan.)[303]201615(Nov.)[304]ca. 5,000(Nov.)[305]201721(Nov.)[306]ca. 7,000(Nov.)[307]201827(Apr.)[308]201933(May)[309]> 6,000(July)[310]20201.8[311]36(May)[312]20212.3[311]74(Feb.)[313]100(Oct.)[313]> 9,500(March)[314]20224.6[315]127(Aug.)[316]ca.\\xa012,000(April)[317]2023ca.\\xa09[318]137(Jan.)[319]180(Dec.)[320]>\\xa013,000(Sept.)[321]2024ca.\\xa015[318](Forecast)350(Nov.)[322]Board of directors[edit]SpaceX board of directors as of January 2021[323]Joined boardNameTitles2002[324]Elon MuskFounder, chairman, CEO and CTO of SpaceX; CEO,Product Architect, and former chairman ofTesla; former chairman ofSolarCity[324]2002[325]Kimbal MuskBoard member, Tesla[326]2009[327]Gwynne ShotwellPresident and COO of SpaceX[328]Luke NosekCo-founder, PayPal[329]Steve JurvetsonCo-founder, Future Ventures fund[330]2010[331]Antonio GraciasCEO and Chairman of the Investment Committee at Valor Equity Partners[332]2015[333]Donald HarrisonPresident of global partnerships and corporate development, Google[334]Leadership changes[edit]In November 2022, the company announced COO Gwynne Shotwell and vice presidentMark Juncosawould oversee Starbase, its Texas launch facility, along with Omead Afshar, who at the time oversaw operations for Tesla in Texas. Shyamal Patel, who was senior director of operations at the site, would shift to its Cape Canaveral site.CNBCreported that these executive moves demonstrated \"the sense of urgency within the company to get Starship flying\".[335][336][337]Workplace culture[edit]According to former NASA deputy administratorLori Garver, the company overall has a male-dominated employee culture,  similar to that of the spaceflight industry in general.[338]In December 2021, claims of workplace sexual harassment from five former SpaceX employees, ranging from interns to full engineers, were published.[339]The former employees claimed to have experienced unwanted advances and uncomfortable interactions.[340]Additionally, the accounts included claims of a culture ofsexual harassmentexisting at the company and one where complaints made to executives, managers, and human resources officers went largely unaddressed.[341]In May 2022, a Business Insider article alleged that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct with a SpaceX flight attendant in a private jet in 2016 citing an anonymous friend of the flight attendant.[342]In response, some employees collaborated on an open letter condemning \"Elon\\'s harmful Twitter behavior\".[343]It also asks the company to clearly define SpaceX\\'s \"no-asshole\" and \"zero tolerance\" policies, which it says is unequally enforced from one employee to the next. The next day, Gwynne Shotwell announced that those employees who were involved with the letter had been terminated and claimed that unsponsored, unsolicited surveys were sent to employees during the work day and that some felt pressured to sign the letter.[344]The company has also been described as having a work culture that pushes employees to work excessively and is described as fostering aburnoutculture.[345]According to a memo byBlue Origin, a rival aerospace company with a history of lawsuits and anti-SpaceX political lobbying,[346][347][348]SpaceX expected very long work hours, work on weekends, and limited use of holidays.[345]In June 2024, eight ex-employees, the same who had previously been fired for penning the open letter against Elon Musk, filed a lawsuit against Musk and SpaceX alleging sexual harassment and discrimination.[349][350]In December 2024, federal agencies investigated SpaceX for security violations as well as Musk\\'s alleged drug use.[351][352]References[edit]^\"Delaware Business Search (File # 3500808\\xa0– Space Exploration Technologies Corp)\".

Improve technology scouting processes and performance with Ezassi research services. The rapid pace of digital transformation presents unparalleled opportunities for growth and innovation. However, it also brings forth significant risks and challenges. To address these, collaborative efforts are necessary to establish shared international leadership to shape guidelines for emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI). The\\xa0United States AI Safety Institute (AISI), positioned by the\\xa0National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), plays a critical role in advancing the science and adoption of\\xa0AI safety\\xa0across various risks, including those related to\\xa0national security,\\xa0public safety, and\\xa0individual rights. Given the increasing capabilities of AI and its potential for both benefits and harm, the defense and aerospace sectors should closely monitor these developments and itspublished AI Terminology Standards. AISI aims to ensure the safe practice of artificial intelligence with strong, responsible strategies andleadershipsuch as Adam Russell, the\\xa0Chief Vision Officer, and Paul Christiano, Head of AI Safety. European policymakers are promoting investment in DefenseTech, and the European Commission introduced adefense industrial strategywith a goal to achieve 40% of equipment jointly procured among EU member states by 2030.\\xa0 However, a key challenge to this growth is institutional investors and their restrictions and ethical concerns around weapon systems. One organization marching forward despite European investor reluctance and the regulatory landscape is British defense contractor4GD. Founded by ex-Royal Marines, it aims to elevate military and law enforcement training standards by incorporating wireless humanoid robotic targetry and integrated, immersive reality technology into real-world operation scenarios. Human performance data capture and the use of SmartFacility simulation environments contribute significantly to military readiness and effectiveness in urban warfare preparation. The entire world is witnessing SpaceX’s lucrative evolution into a key player in defense contracting. With close ties to U.S. military agencies, SpaceX is expanding its role beyond commercial space exploration in programs such asStarshield. The company’s involvement in launching national security satellites and providing reliable transportation for military payloads marks a significant shift in the aerospace industry. As SpaceX strengthens itspartnership with government agencies, it positions itself as a vital asset in ensuring national security and advancing space exploration initiatives. The importance of safety and reliability in aircraft manufacturing demands new technology discovery and improved stakeholder collaboration. Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 and the technical problems and safety issues of the Boeing 737-9 are an opportunity to discuss how major corporations and their innovation ecosystems best ideate, communicate, manufacture, and maintain quality, high performing products. Boeing has encountered significant safety and quality challenges in recent years. To effectively address these issues, it is crucial for a large and technically advanced aerospace company to incorporate robust innovation management. By implementing a renewed innovation strategy, this company, and others like it, can enhance quality control, resolve technical issues faster, and improve communication and transparency throughout the organization. Through this approach, a company can proactively identify and address obstacles before they escalate into major problems, or worse, investigations by the NTSB following failures or crashes. This proactive stance significantly reduces the risk of accidents and enhances overall safety and clarity of mission across the organization. Innovation management also fosters improved and extensive communication among various departments and stakeholders. By adopting a unified platform and collaborating with customers, suppliers, and regulators, an aerospace organization using modern innovation management tools will boost brand loyalty, dependability, and transparency. TheMars Ingenuity Helicopterwas the first powered extraterrestrial aircraft. It concluded its mission on Jan. 18, 2024, due to damage to its rotor blade, ending a historic journey of aerial exploration on Mars. Originally designed for five flights, this 1.2-meter bladed aircraft with solar panel charged Lithium-ion batteries surpassed expectations, completing 72 aerial scouting flights over nearly three years. Its primary goal was a technology demonstration of powered flight on another planet, which it achieved as early as April 19, 2021. While on its mission it achieved new altitude and airspeed records on the Red Planet in the name of experimental flight testing for future space exploration. A dual carbon fiber rotor system for the next generation of Mars helicopters is currently being tested in the 25-foot space simulator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and has reached near supersonic speeds.

       "   'Read How Azure Became a Global LeaderIn recent decades, the rise of cloud computing has transformed the technology landscape, allowing businesses to scale rapidly, enhance security, and manage costs efficiently. Microsoft Azure, one of the leading cloud platforms in the world, has played a pivotal role in this transformation. From its inception, Microsoft Azure has evolved into a global powerhouse, providing a suite of services that cater to a wide range of industries and enterprises. This blog explores the journey of Microsoft’s shift to cloud computing, the rise of Azure, and how it became a global leader.The Cloud Computing Revolution: A Brief OverviewBefore diving into Microsoft Azure\\'s story, it\\'s essential to understand the broader context of cloud computing. Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet (“the cloud”), allowing users to access servers, databases, storage, networking, software, and analytics remotely rather than relying on local infrastructure.Key benefits of cloud computing include:Scalability: Businesses can scale up or down based on demand, without the need to invest in physical hardware.Cost Efficiency: Pay-as-you-go models help companies save on infrastructure and maintenance costs.Mobility: Cloud computing enables employees to access resources from anywhere, enhancing remote work capabilities.Security and Reliability: Leading cloud providers offer robust security measures and data redundancy, ensuring business continuity.By the early 2000s, the demand for cloud solutions began to rise, with companies like Amazon and Google offering their own cloud services. Microsoft recognized this shift and made a strategic decision to transform its offerings and enter the cloud computing space.The Early Days of Microsoft AzureMicrosoft Azure was officially launched in 2010, but the journey began several years earlier. Before Azure, Microsoft had been known for its software solutions, including Windows and Office. However, it faced growing competition from companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), which had already established a foothold in the cloud computing market.Initially called \"Windows Azure,\" Microsoft\\'s cloud platform primarily focused on providing cloud-based infrastructure to run Windows applications. Over time, however, Microsoft expanded its vision for Azure. It rebranded the service as \"Microsoft Azure\" to reflect its broader goals and offerings, including support for various operating systems, programming languages, frameworks, and tools.Azure’s initial challenges included overcoming the perception that Microsoft was a \"legacy\" software company and convincing enterprises to trust its cloud solutions over competitors like AWS. However, Microsoft quickly adapted by listening to customer needs and focusing on hybrid cloud solutions that would allow businesses to integrate cloud services with their existing on-premises infrastructure.Key Factors Behind Azure’s RiseSeveral factors contributed to Azure\\'s rapid growth and rise as a global cloud leader:1. Microsoft’s Enterprise LegacyOne of the most significant advantages Azure had from the beginning was Microsoft\\'s strong relationships with enterprise customers. For decades, businesses had relied on Microsoft products like Windows, Office, and SQL Server. This gave Azure a competitive edge because companies were already familiar with Microsoft\\'s ecosystem and trusted the brand.Azure’s seamless integration with Microsoft’s enterprise solutions, such asActive Directory,Office 365, andSQL Server, made it an attractive option for businesses looking to transition to the cloud without having to overhaul their entire IT infrastructure. Enterprises could migrate gradually, combining on-premises and cloud resources through Azure’s hybrid cloud approach.2. Hybrid Cloud StrategyAzure’s hybrid cloud model was one of the key differentiators that set it apart from competitors. Unlike AWS, which focused primarily on public cloud solutions, Microsoft understood that many businesses were not ready for a full cloud migration. Some companies, particularly in sectors like finance and healthcare, preferred to keep certain workloads on-premises due to regulatory requirements or security concerns.Azure’s hybrid cloud approach allowed businesses to manage and integrate both on-premises infrastructure and cloud services seamlessly. This provided flexibility and ensured that companies could transition to the cloud at their own pace. The introduction ofAzure Stack, which allowed businesses to run Azure services on their own hardware, further cemented Azure’s reputation as the go-to solution for hybrid cloud.3. Global Data Centers and ExpansionTo meet the growing demand for cloud services and ensure low latency for customers around the world, Microsoft made significant investments in building a global network of data centers. Azure now boasts more than 60 regions worldwide, offering businesses the ability to host their applications and data closer to their end users.This global reach has been particularly beneficial for multinational corporations and businesses operating in countries with strict data sovereignty laws. By providing data centers in regions like Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, Azure has enabled companies to comply with local regulations while benefiting from cloud services.4. Support for Open-Source TechnologiesOne of the most surprising shifts in Microsoft’s strategy was its embrace of open-source technologies. Historically, Microsoft had been seen as hostile to open-source platforms, favoring its proprietary software. However, as cloud computing grew in popularity, Microsoft recognized the importance of supporting a wide range of development tools and platforms to attract more customers to Azure.Azure now supports a variety of programming languages, frameworks, and tools, includingLinux,Java,Python, andNode.js. This open and flexible approach has allowed Azure to appeal to a broader audience, including developers who prefer open-source technologies over traditional Microsoft products.5. Focus on AI, Machine Learning, and Edge ComputingAzure’s leadership in cloud computing has also been driven by its focus on emerging technologies such asartificial intelligence (AI),machine learning (ML), andedge computing. Azure provides a comprehensive suite of AI and ML tools, includingAzure Machine LearningandAzure Cognitive Services, enabling businesses to build, deploy, and manage intelligent applications.Moreover, with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the need for real-time data processing at the edge, Azure has positioned itself as a leader inedge computing.Azure IoT HubandAzure Sphereare examples of Microsoft’s commitment to helping businesses harness the power of edge computing, bringing data processing closer to where it’s generated.Recommended by LinkedInAZ-900 Microsoft Azure FundamentalsMoon Karmakar2 months agoGoogle Cloud: The Future of Cloud ComputingDipesh Singla1 year agoFrom On-Prem to Cloud: How Microsoft Azure Can…Mervin Pearce (CISSP-ISSAP)1 year agoKey Services and Solutions in Azure’s EcosystemMicrosoft Azure offers a wide range of services across several categories, including computing, storage, networking, and AI. Here are some of the most popular services within the Azure ecosystem:1. Azure Virtual MachinesAzure Virtual Machines (VMs) allow businesses to run Windows and Linux operating systems in the cloud, providing the flexibility to scale up or down based on demand. Azure VMs are widely used for running applications, hosting websites, and testing software in isolated environments.2. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)As businesses increasingly adopt containerized applications, Kubernetes has become the leading tool for managing these containers.Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)provides a fully managed Kubernetes solution, allowing businesses to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications with ease.3. Azure Blob StorageAzure Blob Storage is an object storage solution designed for handling unstructured data, such as images, videos, and backups. It’s commonly used for storing large amounts of data in the cloud, offering high availability, durability, and scalability.4. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service. It enables businesses to manage user access to applications and resources securely, both in the cloud and on-premises. Azure AD integrates with thousands of third-party applications, making it a crucial tool for businesses managing remote teams.5. Azure DevOpsAzure DevOps provides a suite of tools for managing the entire software development lifecycle. It includes version control, build automation, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and more. Azure DevOps helps development teams collaborate efficiently and deliver software faster.6. Azure Cognitive ServicesAzure Cognitive Services is a collection of AI services that allow developers to add intelligent features to their applications, such as speech recognition, image analysis, and natural language processing. Businesses can use these services to create smarter applications that understand and interact with users more effectively.7. Azure FunctionsAzure Functions is a serverless computing service that allows developers to run code in response to events without managing infrastructure. This service is ideal for building microservices and event-driven applications, helping businesses reduce operational costs by only paying for the resources used during code execution.Challenges and CompetitionDespite its immense success, Azure continues to face challenges in the competitive cloud market. Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the dominant player, holding the largest market share. Google Cloud is also a strong competitor, particularly in the AI and analytics space.Azure’s pricing model can be complex for some businesses, especially smaller companies with limited resources.

Key skills and how to become oneDownload1Download this entire guide for FREE now!Types of cloud computing services offered by Microsoft Azure.How does Microsoft Azure work?Microsoft Azure operates through a vast network of global data centers that ensure high availability and reliability for applications. Once customers subscribe to Azure, they have access to all the services included in the Azure portal. Subscribers can use these services to create cloud-based resources, such as virtual machines (VMs) and databases. Azure resources and services can then be assembled into running environments used to host workloads and store data.In addition to the services that Microsoft offers through the Azure portal, a number of third-party vendors also make software directly available through Azure. The cost billed for third-party applications varies widely but might involve paying a subscription fee for the application, plus a usage fee for the infrastructure used to host the application.Microsoft provides the following five different customer support options for Azure:Basic.Developer.Standard.Professional Direct.Enterprise (Premier).These customer support plans vary in terms of scope and price. Basic support is available to all Azure accounts, but Microsoft charges a fee for the other support offerings. Developer support costs $29 per month, while Standard support costs $100 per month and Professional Direct support is $1,000 per month. Microsoft does not disclose the pricing for Enterprise support.What is Microsoft Azure used for?Because Microsoft Azure consists of widely varied resource and service offerings, its use cases are extremely diverse. Some common use cases of Azure include the following:Running containers.Running VMs orcontainersin the Microsoft cloud is one of the most popular uses for Microsoft Azure. These compute resources can host infrastructure components, such as domain name system (DNS) servers; Windows Server services, such asInternet Information Services; networking services, such as firewalls; or third-party applications. Microsoft also supports the use of third-party operating systems, such as Linux.Hosting databases.Azure is also commonly used as a platform for hosting databases in the cloud. Microsoft offers serverless relational databases, such as Azure SQL, and nonrelational databases, such asNoSQL.Backup and disaster recovery.The Azure platform is frequently used for backup and disaster recovery. Many organizations use Azure for archival storage in order to meet their long-term data retention or disaster recovery requirements.Developing and hosting applications.The Azure platform is utilized for application development, hosting and testing. With Azure's PaaS capabilities, developers can instantly deploy and scale apps without managing the underlying infrastructure or code.Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).Azure offers variousMLtools, including Azure Machine Learning and Azure AI Studio, that businesses can utilize to build, deploy and train ML models. These tools are especially beneficial for organizations adopting ML andAIfor predictive analytics, customer insights and automation.Internet of Things (IoT).Azure provides a comprehensive suite of services designed specifically forIoTapplications, including Azure IoT Hub and Azure Stream Analytics. These tools assist organizations in connecting, monitoring and managing IoT devices and facilitate real-time data collection and analysis.What are the benefits of Azure for modern businesses?Microsoft Azure provides numerous advantages that are specifically designed to meet the needs of contemporary businesses.Here are some of the key benefits:Scalability.Azure enables businesses to quickly adjust resources based on their demand. For example, the resources can be scaled up or down during rapid business growth or seasonal shifts.Cost efficiency.Migrating to Azure can substantially lower the IT costs for businesses compared to maintaining their own on-premises infrastructure. With a PAYG pricing model, organizations only pay for the resources they use, helping them manage budgets and reduce capital expenses.AI and advanced analytics.Azure offersadvanced analytics toolsand AI services that help businesses extract valuable insights from their data and enhance their decision-making processes.Global reach and high availability.Azure's global infrastructure enables businesses to access applications and data from anywhere and also ensures high availability and redundancy.

This setup is especially helpful for businesses that require a blend of both compliance and performance needs.Support for open source technologies.To provide organizations with the flexibility to utilize their preferred systems and frameworks, Azure is compatible with a broad range of open source tools and technologies, such as Linux and Kubernetes.Azure features and servicesMicrosoft sorts Azure cloud services into nearly two dozen categories, which are typically categorized into three main types: foundational, mainstream and strategic. This classification helps users understand the maturity and usage level of each service. Generally, services begin as strategic and progress to mainstream and foundational as their demand and usage increase, and each category can include numerous specific instances or service types.The most popular service categories include the following:Compute.The compute services enable a user to deploy and manage VMs, containers and batch jobs, as well as support remote application access. Compute resources created within the Azure cloud can be configured with either publicInternet Protocol (IP) addressesor private IP addresses, depending on whether the resource needs to be accessible to the outside world.Mobile.These products help developers build cloud applications for mobile devices, providing notification services, support for back-end tasks, tools for building application programming interfaces (APIs) and the ability to couple geospatial context with data.Web.These services support the development and deployment of web apps. They also offer features for search, content delivery,API management, notification and reporting.Storage.This category of services provides scalablecloud storagefor structured and unstructured data. It also supports big data projects, persistent storage and archival storage.Analytics.These services provide distributed analytics and storage, as well as features for real-time analytics, big data analytics, data lakes, machine learning, business intelligence, IoT data streams and data warehousing.Networking.This group includes virtual networks, dedicated connections and gateways as well as services for traffic management and diagnostics, load balancing, DNS hosting and network protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.Media and content delivery network (CDN).TheseCDNservices include on-demand streaming, digital rights protection, encoding, and media playback and indexing.Integration.These are services for server backup, site recovery and connecting private andpublic clouds.Serverless computing.Azure supports serverless computing and architectures that let developers build applications without managing servers. This helps with the automatic scaling of resources and enables the developers to focus on coding instead of managing the underlying infrastructure. For example,Azure Functionsenables developers to write and execute code in their preferred language without managing servers.Identity.These offerings ensure only authorized users can access Azure services and help protect encryption keys and other sensitive information in the cloud. Services include support forMicrosoft Entra IDandmultifactor authentication.IoT.These services help users capture, monitor and analyze IoT data from sensors and other devices. Services include notifications, analytics, monitoring and support for coding and execution.DevOps.This group provides project and collaboration tools, such asAzure DevOps-- formerly Visual Studio Team Services -- that facilitate DevOps software development processes. It also offers features for application diagnostics, DevOps tool integrations and test labs for build tests and experimentation.Development.These services help application developers share code, test applications and track potential issues. Azure supports a range of application programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, .NET, Go and Node.js. Tools in this category also include support for Azure DevOps,software development kitsandblockchain.Security and identity management.These products provide capabilities to identify and respond to cloud security threats as well as manage encryption keys and other sensitive assets.AI and machine learning.This is a wide range of services that a developer can use to infuse AI, ML and cognitive computing capabilities into applications and data sets.Containers.These services help an enterprise create, register, orchestrate and manage huge volumes of containers in the Azure cloud, using common container platforms such asDockerand orchestration platforms including Kubernetes.Databases.This category includesdatabase-as-a-serviceofferings for SQL and NoSQL, as well as other database instances -- such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. It also includes Azure Synapse Analytics support, caching, and hybrid database integration and migration features. Azure SQL is the platform's flagship database service. It is a relational database that provides SQL functionality without the need for deploying a SQL server.Migration.This suite of tools helps an organization estimate workload migration costs and perform the actualmigration of workloads from local data centers to the Azure cloud.Management and governance.These services provide a range of backup, recovery, compliance, automation, scheduling and monitoring tools that can help a cloud administrator manage an Azure deployment.Mixed reality.These services are designed to help developers create content for the Windows Mixed Reality environment.Intune.Microsoft Intunecan be used to enroll user devices, thereby making it possible to push security policies and mobile apps to those devices. Mobile apps can be deployed either to groups of users or to a collection of devices. Intune also provides tools for tracking which apps are being used. A remote wipe feature enables the organization's data to be securely removed from devices without removing a user's mobile apps in the process.Examine how Azure and the Azure Stack variations compare.Azure for DR and backupSome organizations use Azure fordata backupanddisaster recovery. Organizations can also use Azure as an alternative to their own data center storage. Public clouds have proven ideal for high-volume, short-duration tasks such as data analytics. Organizations can use almost limitless storage capacity in the cloud to store vast data sets, perform analytics tasks and then dismiss data as it ages or becomes unusable -- all without procuring or deploying hardware in a local data center. This type ofutility computinghas been a fundamental driver behind public cloud adoption since its inception.Rather than invest in local servers and storage, increasing numbers of organizations choose to run some, or all, of their business applications in Azure. To ensure availability, Microsoft has Azure data centers located around the world. At the time of writing, Microsoft Azure services are available in more than 60 regions with 300-plus data centers spread globally. Unfortunately, not all services are available in all regions. Therefore, Azure users must confirm that workload and data storage locations comply with all prevailing compliance requirements or other legislation.Privacy and Microsoft AzureData security concerns andregulatory compliancerequirements make privacy a major issue for cloud subscribers. To address these worries, Microsoft has created the online Trust Center, which provides detailed information about the company's security, privacy and compliance initiatives.According to the Trust Center, Microsoft will only use customer data if it is necessary to provide the agreed-upon services and it will never disclose customer data to government agencies unless it is required by law.At the same time, Azure provides numerous security services, such as identity and access management (IAM) and firewalls, to help Azure users establish a secure infrastructure and monitor for intrusion in a timely manner. Security services are critical to public cloud adoption by helping users safeguard the privacy of sensitive data and important workloads.Azure pricing and costsSimilar to other public cloud providers, Azure primarily uses a PAYG pricing model that charges based on usage. However, if a single application uses multiple Azure services, each service might involve multiple pricing tiers. It's common for one service to use a subset of other services -- each adding to the total cost of the intended service.For example, a common application running in a VM might incur one cost. The storage instance associated with the workload might incur a second cost. Networking services and reporting tools might all driveadditional costs for the workload. Alternatively, services such as Azure Functions are free, but users pay for the compute and other resources needed to run the function for the duration of the function's execution -- usually to the closest second.In addition, if a user makes a long-term commitment to certain services, such as compute instances, Microsoft offers a discounted rate. For example, Azure reserved VM instances claim to save users up to 80% on VM costs.Even simple applications can involve many interdependent cloud services and resources. Given the many factors involved in cloud service pricing, an organization should review andmanage its cloud usage to minimize costs. Azure-native tools, such as Microsoft Cost Management, can help monitor, visualize and optimize cloud spending. It's also possible to use third-party tools, such as IBM Cloudability, along with emerging FinOps practices to manage Azure resource usage and associated costs.Significant Azure outagesMicrosoft Azure has a history of major outages dating back to early 2012.

Users can research specific outages, detailed implications, underlying causes and fixes at Microsoft's Azurestatus history page.Azure competitionMicrosoft Azure is one of severalmajor public cloud service providersoperating on a large global scale. Other major clouds includeGoogle Cloud,AWS, Oracle,IBM Cloudand Alibaba Cloud. Currently, there is a lack of standardization among cloud services and capabilities.Most cloud providers offer a broad suite of similar services, but no two cloud providers offer the same service in the exact same way. Cloud providers rely on APIs and other integrations to handle provisioning and services programmatically. Because each provider uses unique APIs, the onus is on users to accommodate differences between cloud providers. Thus, migrating a workload from one cloud to another might require significant recoding of the application or rearchitecting of the cloud environment to support the workload. This makes it difficult for a business to use more than one public cloud provider when pursuing amulti-cloud strategy. Third-party cloud management tools can reduce some of these challenges.In addition to major cloud providers, Azure faces competition in the small to midsize sector. For example, DigitalOcean is a popular alternative for small to midsize companies looking for cloud services.Compare the always-free and free-tier offerings from major cloud providers.Azure historyMicrosoft first unveiled its plans to introduce a cloud computing service called Windows Azure in 2008. Preview versions of the service became available and developed, leading to its commercial launch in early 2010. Although early iterations of Azure cloud services fell behind more established offerings, such as AWS, the portfolio continued to evolve and support a larger base of programming languages, frameworks and operating systems.In 2014, Microsoft rebranded Windows Azure to Microsoft Azure, reflecting its broader scope beyond just Windows-based services. By early 2014, Microsoft had added and updated a wide range of services including Azure SQL, Windows Azure CTP, Windows Azure Connect, Traffic Manager and HPC scheduler. Microsoft recognized that the implications of cloud computing stretched far beyond Windows, and the service was rebranded as Microsoft Azure. In addition, Azure rolled out the first public previews of Machine Learning services.In the following years, Azure introduced Sonic (a cross-platform Linux distribution), Azure Resource Manager Portal (2015), Azure Service Fabric (2016), Azure Service Fabric Mesh (2018) and Azure IoT Central (2018). Today, Azure is regarded as a strong commercial competitor to other public cloud providers.All major cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud, offer robust IAM frameworks, but they differ in their features, configuration, resource hierarchy and pricing models.Compare these IAM differencesto help select the best option for your organizational needs and technology ecosystems.This was last updated inJanuary 2025Continue Reading About What is Microsoft Azure and how does it work?IaaS vs. PaaS options on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud PlatformA cloud services cheat sheet for AWS, Azure and Google CloudThe future of cloud computing: Top trends and predictionsHow to conduct a cloud security assessmentBest practices for a cloud-first strategyRelated TermsWhat is a cloud service provider?A cloud service provider, or CSP, is a company that offers components of cloud computing -- typically in an as-a-service model ...See\\xa0complete\\xa0definitionWhat is cloud transformation and how do you get started?Cloud transformation is a migration process in which a business's IT infrastructure, data, applications and software are moved to...See\\xa0complete\\xa0definitionWhat is Google Cloud Nearline storage?Google Cloud Nearline storage is a public cloud storage class intended for storing infrequently accessed data.See\\xa0complete\\xa0definitionDig Deeper on Cloud provider platforms and toolsMicrosoft outages: The implications of downtime on the delivery of critical public servicesBy:Owen\\xa0SayersMicrosoft confirms DDoS attack disrupted cloud servicesBy:Arielle\\xa0WaldmanWhat happens when the IT infrastructure is too big to fail?By:Owen\\xa0SayersIs cloud critical infrastructure?

Green energy, also known asrenewable energy or clean energy, refers to energy generated from natural and sustainable sources that have minimal negative impact on the environment. Examples of green energy sources include solar power, wind power, green hydrogen, hydro power, geothermal energy, and biomass. Green energy sources are considered sustainable because they are naturally replenished, unlike fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which are finite and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Green energy is increasingly being adopted by individuals, businesses, and governments as a way to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and promote a more sustainable future. Investing in stocks requires careful analysis of financial data to find out a company's true worth. However, an easier way to find out about a company's performance is to look at its financial ratios. Two commonly used financial ratios used in the valuation of stocks are - Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)- It compares the company's stock price with its earnings per share. The higher the P/E ratio, the more expensive the stock. Price to Book Value Ratio (P/BV) - It compares a firm's market capitalization to its book value. A high P/BV indicates markets believe the company's assets to be undervalued and vice versa. Having said that, the two key indices to track are the BSE Sensex which contains thelist of BSE 30 stocksand the NSE Nifty which contains thelist of NSE 50 stocks. However, these two indices are considered to be too narrow by some, since they only track 30 and 50 stocks, respectively. For broader tracking, you could use theBSE 200,BSE 500or even theNSE 500index. Some popular market cap based indices includeBSE Smallcap indexandBSE Midcap index, among others. Asian equities climbed in early Monday trading, tracking US peers following a positive conversation between Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping ahead of the US President-elect's inauguration.

These companies are at the forefront of developing cleaner, more efficient energy solutions that can help mitigate environmental damage.Green Energy vs Renewable EnergyGreen energy and renewable energy are terms often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings. Green energy refers to energy produced from natural sources that have minimal impact on the environment. This includes solar, wind, geothermal, and certain types of biomass. Green energy is characterised by its low carbon emissions and lack of pollution during production, making it an environmentally friendly option. The primary goal of green energy is to reduce the negative effects of traditional energy sources, such as fossil fuels, on the environment and public health.Renewable energy, on the other hand, encompasses a broader category that includes all energy sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. This includes solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass energy. While most renewable energy sources are green, some are not entirely free of environmental impacts. For example, large-scale hydroelectric projects can disrupt local ecosystems and displace communities, and some biomass projects can result in deforestation if not managed sustainably. Therefore, while all green energy sources are renewable, not all renewable energy sources are considered green. The distinction lies in the environmental impact and sustainability of the energy production methods.Why Invest in Green Energy Stocks in India?Investing in green energy stocks in India offers you a unique opportunity to capitalise on the country’s rapidly growing renewable energy sector. With ambitious government targets for clean energy adoption and increasing public awareness about climate change, these stocks are poised for potential long-term growth. By investing in green energy, you’re not just aiming for financial returns and contributing to a sustainable future for India and the world.Moreover, green energy stocks can help diversify your investment portfolio.

       "   'Most commercial sites, from social media platforms to news outlets to online retailers, collect a wide variety of data about their users’ behaviors. Platforms use this data to deliver content and recommendations based on users’ interests and traits, and to allow advertisers totarget adsto relatively precise segments of the public. But how well do Americans understand these algorithm-driven classification systems, and how much do they think their lives line up with what gets reported about them? As a window into this hard-to-study phenomenon, a new Pew Research Center survey asked a representative sample of users of the nation’s most popular social media platform, Facebook, to reflect on the data that had been collected about them. (See more about why we study Facebook in the boxbelow.)Facebook makes it relatively easy for users to find out how the site’s algorithm has categorized their interests via a “Your ad preferences” page.1Overall, however, 74% of Facebook users say they did not know that this list of their traits and interests existed until they were directed to their page as part of this study.When directed to the “ad preferences” page, the large majority of Facebook users (88%) found that the site had generated some material for them. A majority of users (59%) say these categories reflect their real-life interests, while 27% say they are not very or not at all accurate in describing them. And once shown how the platform classifies their interests, roughly half of Facebook users (51%) say they are not comfortable that the company created such a list.The survey also asked targeted questions about two of the specific listings that are part of Facebook’s classification system: users’ political leanings, and their racial and ethnic “affinities.”In both cases, more Facebook users say the site’s categorization of them is accurate than say it is inaccurate. At the same time, the findings show that portions of users think Facebook’s listings for them are not on the mark.When it comes to politics, about half of Facebook users (51%) are assigned a political “affinity” by the site. Among those who are assigned a political category by the site, 73% say the platform’s categorization of their politics is very or somewhat accurate, while 27% say it describes them not very or not at all accurately. Put differently, 37% of Facebook users are both assigned a political affinityandsay that affinity describes them well, while 14% are both assigned a category and say it does not represent them accurately.For some users, Facebook also lists a category called “multicultural affinity.” According to third-party online courses about how totarget adson Facebook, this listing is meant to designate a user’s “affinity” with various racial and ethnic groups, rather than assign them to groups reflecting theiractualrace or ethnic background. Only about a fifth of Facebook users (21%) say they are listed as having a “multicultural affinity.” Overall, 60% of users who are assigned a multicultural affinity category say they do in fact have a very or somewhat strong affinity for the group to which they are assigned, while 37% say their affinity for that group is not particularly strong. Some 57% of those who are assigned to this category say they do in fact consider themselves to be a member of the racial or ethnic group to which Facebook assigned them.These are among the findings from a survey of a nationally representative sample of 963 U.S. Facebook users ages 18 and older conducted Sept. 4 to Oct. 1, 2018, on GfK’s KnowledgePanel.A second survey of a representative sample of all U.S. adults who use social media – including Facebook and other platforms like Twitter and Instagram – using Pew Research Center’sAmerican Trends Panelgives broader context to the insights from the Facebook-specific study.This second survey, conducted May 29 to June 11, 2018, reveals that social media users generally believe it would be relatively easy for the platforms they use to determine key traits about them based on the data they have amassed about their behaviors. Majorities of social media users say it would be very or somewhat easy for these platforms to determine their race or ethnicity (84%), their hobbies and interests (79%), their political affiliation (71%) or their religious beliefs (65%). Some 28% of social media users believe it would be difficult for these platforms to figure out their political views, nearly matching the share of Facebook users who are assigned a political listing but believe that listing is not very or not at all accurately.Why we study FacebookPew Research Center chose to study Facebook for this research on public attitudes about digital tracking systems and algorithms for a number of reasons. For one, the platform is used by a considerablybiggernumber of Americans than otherpopular social media platformslike Twitter and Instagram. Indeed, its global user base isbigger than the populationof many countries. Facebook is the third most trafficked website in theworldand fourth most in theUnited States. Along withGoogle, Facebook dominates thedigital advertisingmarket, and the firm itselfelaborately documentshow advertisers can micro-target audience segments. In addition, the Center’s studies have shown that Facebook holds a special and meaningful place in thesocialandcivicuniverse of its users.The company allows users to view at least a partial compilation of how it classifies them on the page called “Your ad preferences.” It is relatively simple to find this page, which allows researchers to direct Facebook users to their preferences page and ask them about what they see.Users can find their own preferences page by following the directions in theMethodology sectionof this report. They canopt outof being categorized this way for ad targeting, but they will still get other kinds ofless-targeted adson Facebook.Most Facebook users say they are assigned categories on their ad preferences pageA substantial share of websites and appstrackhow people use digital services, and they use that data to deliver services, content or advertising targeted to those with specific interests or traits. Typically, the precise workings of the proprietary algorithms that perform these analyses are unknowable outside the companies who use them. At the same time, it is clear the process of algorithmically assessing users and their interests involves a lot of informed guesswork about the meaning of a user’s activities and how those activities add up to elements of a user’s identity.Facebook, the most prominent social network in the world, analyzes scores of different dimensions of itsusers’ livesthat advertisers are then invited to target. The company allows users to view at least a partial compilation of how it classifies them on the page called “Your ad preferences.” The page, which is different for each user, displays several types of personal information about the individual user, including “your categories” – a list of a user’s purported interests crafted by Facebook’s algorithm. The categorization system takes into account data provided by users to the site and their engagement with content on the site, such as the material they have posted, liked, commented on and shared.These categories might also include insights Facebook has gathered from a user’s online behavior outside of the Facebook platform. Millions ofcompanies and organizationsaround the world have activated theFacebook pixelon their websites. The Facebook pixel records the activity of Facebook users on these websites and passes this data back to Facebook. This information then allows the companies and organizations who have activated the pixel to better target advertising to their website users who also use the Facebook platform. Beyond that, Facebook hasa toolallowing advertisers to link offline conversions and purchases to users – that is, track the offline activity of users after they saw or clicked on a Facebook ad – and find audiences similar to people who have converted offline. (Users can opt out of having their information used by this targeting feature.)Overall, the array of information can cover users’ demographics, social networks and relationships, political leanings, life events, food preferences, hobbies, entertainment interests and the digital devices they use.Advertiserscan select from these categories to target groups of users for their messages. The existence of this material on the Facebook profile for each user allows researchers to work with Facebook users to explore their own digital portrait as constructed by Facebook.The Center’s representative sample of American Facebook users finds that 88% say they are assigned categories in this system, while 11% say that after they are directed to their ad preferences page they get a message saying, “You have no behaviors.”Some six-in-ten Facebook users report their preferences page lists either 10 to 20 (27%) or 21 or more (33%) categories for them, while 27% note their list contains fewer than 10 categories.Those who are heavier users of Facebook and those who have used the site the longest are more likely to be listed in a larger number of personal interest categories. Some 40% of those who use the platform multiple times a day are listed in 21 or more categories, compared with 16% of those who are less-than-daily users. Similarly, those who have been using Facebook for 10 years or longer are more than twice as likely as those with less than five years of experience to be listed in 21 or more categories (48% vs. 22%).74% of Facebook users say they did not know about the platform’s list of their interestsAbout three-quarters of Facebook users (74%) say they did not know this list of categories existed on Facebook before being directed to the page in the Center’s survey, while 12% say they were aware of it.2Put differently, 84% of those who reported that Facebook had categorized their interests did not know about it until they were directed to their ad preferences page.When asked how accurately they feel the list represents them and their interests, 59% of Facebook users say the list very (13%) or somewhat (46%) accurately reflects their interests. Meanwhile, 27% of Facebook users say the list not very (22%) or not at all accurately (5%) represents them.Yet even with a majority of users noting that Facebook at least somewhat accurately assesses their interests, about half of users (51%) say they are not very or not at all comfortable with Facebook creating this list about their interests and traits. This means that 58% of those whom Facebook categorizes are not generally comfortable with that process. Conversely, 5% of Facebook users say they are very comfortable with the company creating this list and another 31% declare they are somewhat comfortable.There is clear interplay between users’ comfort with the Facebook traits-assignment process and the accuracy they attribute to the process. About three-quarters of those who feel the listings for them are not very or not at all accurate (78%) say they are uncomfortable with lists being created about them, compared with 48% of those who feel their listing is accurate.Facebook’s political and ‘racial affinity’ labels do not always match users’ viewsIt is relatively common for Facebook to assign political labels to its users. Roughly half (51%) of those in this survey are given such a label. Those assigned a political label are roughly equally divided between those classified as liberal or very liberal (34%), conservative or very conservative (35%) and moderate (29%).Among those who are assigned a label on their political views, close to three-quarters (73%) say the listing very accurately or somewhat accurately describes their views. Meanwhile, 27% of those given political classifications by Facebook say that label is not very or not at all accurate.There is some variance between what users say about their political ideology and what Facebook attributes to them.3Specifically, self-described moderate Facebook users are more likely than others to say they are not classified accurately. Among those assigned a political category, some 20% of self-described liberals and 25% of those who describe themselves as conservative say they are not described well by the labels Facebook assigns to them. But that share rises to 36% among self-described moderates.In addition to categorizing users’ political views, Facebook’s algorithm assigns some users to groups by “multicultural affinity,” which the firm says it assigns to people whose Facebook activity “aligns with” certain cultures. About one-in-five Facebook users (21%) say they are assigned such an affinity.The use of multicultural affinity as a tool for advertisers to exclude certain groups has created controversies. Following pressure fromCongressand investigations byProPublica, Facebooksigned an agreementin July 2018 with the Washington State Attorney General saying it would no longer let advertisers unlawfully exclude users by race, religion, sexual orientation and other protected classes.In this survey, 43% of those given an affinity designation are said by Facebook’s algorithm to have an interest in African American culture, and the same share (43%) is assigned an affinity with Hispanic culture. One-in-ten are assigned an affinity with Asian American culture. Facebook’sdetailed targeting toolfor ads does not offer affinity classifications for any other cultures in the U.S., including Caucasian or white culture.Of those assigned a multicultural affinity, 60% say they have a “very” or “somewhat” strong affinity for the group they were assigned, compared with 37% who say they do not have a strong affinity or interest.4And 57% of those assigned a group say they consider themselves to be a member of that group, while 39% say they are not members of that group.',\n",
       "   'Facebook, Instagram and TikTok are no longer social media platforms. Yes, it’s true. TikTok never was, and both Instagram and Facebook have followed their path in a quest for growth. Which begs the question, how are you defining social media Mary? Social media, when it first began in the mid 2000’s was indeed social. It was about connecting you to friends and family. Over time, other bits of content made their way into the feed. First it was news, then it was sponsored content and ads. The business machine of social media has been driven by finance and quarterly results, ever since platforms went public. The drive for profit dictates the feed, with everything focused on keeping eyeballs there, to be able to serve up paid content. That quest continues, and in the face of rising competition from TikTok, Facebook and Instagram have gone all in on discovery-based content. Have you noticed people showing up in your feed you don’t know? Have you noticed content that may or may not interest you – sometimes leaving you to scratch your head and ask, “why is this here?” That’s the discovery algorithm at work. In theory it should put content in your feed that reflects your interests. Discovery serves up stuff the platform thinks we will find entertaining or valuable, because in doing that, we will spend more time, and when we spend more time in the feed, they can serve us more ads. It’s the cold hard truth. Instagram reels is basically TikTok 2.0. TikTok has a crazy accurate algorithm that manages to show content based on your profile and what you have engaged with in the past, which is what makes the app so addictive. Instagram, in their quest for growth (or more accurately, an effort to stop the hemorrhaging of users shifting to TikTok), has gone all in on reels and discovery. It has become a vertical first platform of video, and is no longer a photo first platform it once was. YouTube and Pinterest never were social media. They were visual search engines, where people gathered to learn or be entertained. You could argue that YouTube is playing the discovery game too, lead by their newest for of content – YouTube Shorts, not unlike TikTok videos and IG reels. But at its heart, YouTube is a search engine for learning and entertainment. And being owned by Google, allows them to show up in SEO search like no other platform. Pinterest is undeniably visual search. It’s one of the only platforms that doesn’t penalize for taking viewers out of the feed with website links. In fact it encourages it with their primary product – visual pins linked to content. So if Facebook and Instagram are no longer social media, what does it matter? It just signals a shift away from connecting as the primary focus, to discovery of content of interest. On some level that’s more intuitive, since it feeds human nature to engage with content in interest areas. But the very thing that has fueled social media success in the past – the number of followers, now matters a whole lot less, if at all. I would argue the number of followers is soon to be relegated to a vanity metric in terms of real value. What will matter more going forward is the ability to create content that will engage and hold an interested audience. And increasingly, the shift is towards short form vertical video. Call it the TikTok effect. Welcome to social media going into 2023! Of course this might be a bit of an over simplification, but it’s a shift that many content creators have yet to acknowledge in their strategies. And I haven’t even addressed what change could look like at Twitter (Elon anyone?) of how LinkedIn as the steady eddy might be the dark horse in it all.

       "   'Multichannel social media strategy:Social media is no longer a small experimental part of marketing.Social media spendingrepresents 15% of marketing budgets and is expected to increase to nearly 25% in five years. Social media is also seen as an essential part of digital marketing which has surpassed traditional withdigital ad spendingreaching 54% of total ad sales. Today brands must go beyond the top three social platforms or simply continue to use current brand social platforms. As social media plans become more sophisticated with a combination of organic and paid content how do you decide among the over200 social media platforms? To simplify this process the chart below lists social options in eight categories by key characteristics and top platforms per category.Click herefor an updated version of this article and guide.Audience Size and Engagement:Total audience size is important when selecting a social media platform within which to invest your time and money. Yet tradition measures of monthly active users or unique monthly visitors only tell part of the story. A user could visit a platform once a month and be included in audience size. Engagement is another important factor that looks at how active those users are on the platform. How many users are daily users and how much time are they spending per day or session?Target Audience Demographics:How active is your target audience on each platform? Define\\xa0 target audience by demographic characteristics such as gender, education, income, ethnicity and age. Look for social media platforms popular with your target age group. Be sure to look at both monthly active and daily active users by age. A high percent of Millennials may be monthly users of Facebook but if you look at daily usage they may be spending more time on Instagram. If your target is Gen Y, Snapchat may have the highest daily usage.Target Audience Psychographics:Not all people in a generation have the same interests, therefore it is also important to define target audience with psychographic variables such as, values, beliefs and interests. People interested in crafts, fashion, the environment, or gaming may be active on other social media platforms where those interests are popular such as Reddit, Pinterest, Forums or Twitch.Target Business Category:Not all purchase decisions are considered in the same social media channels. Therefore also consider type of business. Is the brand B2C or B2B? What industry is it in? Is it a local or national company? Does the brand offer online sales, in-person or a combination of both? The type of business could make other social media channels more relevant to a plan such as LinkedIn, TripAdvisor or Yelp.Target Communication Objective:Finally, consider the communications objective. A plan to build brand awareness may work best with Facebook, YouTube and Buzzfeed. A plan to improve customer response may work better in Twitter and Messenger for customer support and Google My Business for customer reviews. A B2B lead generation plan may best leverage Blogs, Podcasts, LinkedIn and Slack. A direct sales plan for a multinational fashion brand could work best with Instagram, Pinterest, WhatsApp and WeChat.Now that you know what to consider in selecting plans.

       "   'A few decades ago, there were only a handful to choose from, withFacebook being a forerunner when it was created back in 2004. Now, there are dozens of social media sites on offer. It pays to do your research and focus on the ones that will work best for your brand. A social media platform or site is a website or app, such as Facebook or Instagram, that allows users to take part in social networking. You can share thoughts, ideas, and interests by creating content, sharing it, commenting on other users’ content, and reposting. The first ever social media platform wasinvented by Andrew Weinreich in 1997. It was called SixDegrees.comand it introduced a million people to social networking. It was a short-lived experiment because few people had adequate internet facilities to use the platform effectively. According to Hootsuite’s Digital 2024 Global Overview Report, the most popular social media platforms include Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, and Instagram. Facebook continues to be the most well-known social media platform worldwide, with 2.9 billion active users per month. Despite its vast user base, when users aged 16 to 64 were asked about their favorite platform, WhatsApp emerged as the top choice for 15.7% of respondents. Instagram followed closely with 14.8%, and Facebook itself was preferred by 14.5% of users. WhatsApp’s popularity highlights its importance as a messaging and communication tool across different age groups. Instagram remains a favorite due to its focus on visual content and user engagement features. Meanwhile, Facebook, while slightly behind in terms of user preference, still commands a massive audience. Twitter, now known as X, has seen a decline in its user preference, with only 3.3% of users naming it their favorite platform. This is a significant drop for a platform that started in 2006 as a microblogging site with a 140-character limit and has since evolved to include photo and video sharing. Despite these changes, it maintains around 330 million active monthly users, a figure that held steady at the time of Elon Musk’s $44 billion acquisition. LinkedIn remains the top platform for professional networking, boasting over 774 million registered users. It is widely used for connecting with industry peers and exploring job opportunities. YouTube stands out with more than 2 billion visits per month, making it the second-largest search engine after Google. Users spend an average of 23.7 hours per month on YouTube, more time than on any other social media platform, reflecting its dominant role in video content consumption. All these platforms offer brands opportunities for promoted posts and ads, making them essential tools for digital marketing strategies. Makeawebsitehub.comhas identified more than 100 social media sites with new ones appearing regularly. Some disappear without a trace, while others can grow dramatically. For example, you might not have heard of Mastodon before Elon Musk bought Twitter, but social media users are now flocking to it. Hive is another Twitter alternative that’s growing in popularity. These are the social media platforms thatSproutSocialidentifies as those that brands and consumers are most likely to populate in the next year. According toBuffer, the 10 best-known social media platforms for brands are as follows, ranked by their monthly active users or MAU. (LinkedIn isn’t included as it’s considered a professional networking site.) Here’s a comprehensive list of 50 global social media platforms that brands should know about: There are five types of social media platform. They are: According to Statista, the top five social media sites in 2023 were: According toStatistica, the top five social media sites in 2022 were: Social Media.co.ukranked the top five social media sites for 2021 as follows: (In 2022, Twitter was knocked off the 5th spot by WeChat) When planning your social media strategy, it’s important to consider the demographics of each platform. For example, if you’re marketing to teens, you’ll most likely get better results on TikTok than you would on Facebook, which attracts an older audience. Similarly, the gender you’re targeting may play a role in the platforms you prioritise. For example, Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn have a relatively even split between male and female. However, TikTok and Pinterest have a much larger lean towards female, whilst Twitter and YouTube have more male users. All of these types of demographic differences can play a key role when approaching your social media strategy. Facebook is the largest social media platform in the world. It wasfounded in 2004 and went public in 2012. The parent company, Meta, also owns WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger. The biggest demographic on Facebook is males aged between 25 and 34. It’s fallen out of fashion with younger users andonly 2.4% of females aged 13 to 17 use the platform, along with 3.2% of males in the same age group. A Facebook for business page will allow you to connect with your customers and receive private messages on Facebook Messenger. You can also utilise the Insights, which will tell you the gender, age, and location of users interacting with your page. With so many platforms on offer, choosing the right ones can feel daunting when planning your social media strategy.Find out how other brands have used Vamp to create winning campaigns. We’re an officialTikTok marketing partnerand can help yourbusiness create a killer social media planby connecting you with creators and simplifying the collaboration process.Get started today. To measure the effectiveness of social media campaigns, brands should use key performance indicators (KPIs) such as engagement rates (likes, comments, shares), reach and impressions, follower growth, click-through rates (CTR), and conversion rates. Tools like Google Analytics, social media insights, and third-party platforms like Hootsuite and Sprout Social can provide detailed analytics. Additionally, tracking specific campaign goals, such as lead generation or sales, can help in assessing the return on investment (ROI) of social media efforts. Emerging trends in social media marketing include the rise of short-form video content, such as TikTok and Instagram Reels, and the increasing importance of authenticity and user-generated content. Brands are also leveraging influencer partnerships and exploring augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences. Social commerce is growing, with more platforms offering direct shopping features. Personalization and data-driven marketing are becoming crucial for targeting specific audiences and enhancing user engagement. Different demographic groups use social media platforms in varied ways. For instance, younger audiences favor TikTok and Instagram, while older demographics are more active on Facebook. To tailor content effectively, brands should conduct demographic research and use platform analytics to understand user behavior. Content should be customized in terms of language, style, and format to resonate with each demographic. For example, brands targeting Gen Z might use memes and short videos, while content for older adults could be more informative and detailed.',\n",

And evidently, it’s succeeding.As a privately held company, ByteDance is not required to disclose financial information, so we cannot be certain of TikTok’s annual revenue. However, a report from Bloomberg suggests the parent company generated somewhere in the ballpark of$80 billionin 2022 – and the social app accounts for a percentage of that.TikTok’s meteoric rise over the past few years has been unprecedented.

For this reason, it’s a worthwhile tool for brands that want to authentically speak to a younger demographic who might be less interested in the broader approaches of other social networks.And while it may not get as much attention as the likes of Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat is quietly humming along.

However, in mid-2021, the company referred to having hit$100 million in quarterly ad revenue– so, based on this, we can reasonably assume it’s in the ballpark of $400 million.It has become known as the dominant digital watercooler, and replaced forums and chatrooms of yore to be the go-to place for connecting with likeminded communities and getting your questions answered.Reddit has a unique blend of content and community, with more than2.8 millioncommunities, or subreddits, dedicated to every topic imaginable.

Users don’t typically respond well to blatant self-promotion, and marketing gimmicks will be met with sharp skepticism.Brands should beware before wandering into any subreddit and trying to tout their products to community members.It’s crucial to get the tone right from the beginning, as commentators won’t hesitate to call out and critique what they perceive as inauthentic.Engage thoughtfully, contribute genuinely, and Reddit could be an incredible marketing tool for your brand.A Beginner’s Guide to Reddit: How to Get Started & Be Successful43 Best Subreddits For Marketing ProfessionalsGetting Started With Reddit Advertising: What You Need To Know9.

       "   \"Jessie Homewood on the four main categories of social media for the hotel industry.Following on from part one in our series (why social media is so important), this week we will explore the four main categories of social media platforms and what you can do to get started on your social journey.Social media is a collective term for any digital tool (think websites and applications) that allows people to quickly communicate and interact, share content, and collaborate. People use social media to stay in touch and interact with friends, family and various communities. It encompasses a wide range of websites and apps. Some, like Twitter, specialize in sharing links and short written messages. Others, like Instagram and TikTok, are built to primarily share photos and videos.The four main categories of social media platforms for hotels:There are four main categories of social media platforms that are relevant to the hotel industry at present, though these categories shift and change rapidly – much like the platforms that are contained within them:1. Social networksMost of us will be familiar with social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn (you're using it right now so I hope you are). People use these networks to connect with one another and share information, thoughts, and ideas. The focus of these networks is usually on the user. User profiles help participants identify other users with common interests or concerns. Facebook is a good example of a social network.So how can social networking sites help your hotel?Reach potential hotel guests through content and ads: By their very nature, these platforms cultivate large, diverse communities.\\xa0Your hotel can look to gain an audience with these communities through growing your profile and posting regular content, as well as through paid advertisements. Because these platforms are incredibly data-rich, you have the ability to target and reach potential customers at scale without blowing your entire marketing budget.Network: You can build relationships and engage with potential guests and relevant industry figures through hashtags and discussion groups.Research: Social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter are a great place for undertaking customer research and seeing what your competitors are up to. You can use hashtags to browse conversations happening around a specific brand or topic, or even better - use social listening tools to track those conversations at scale. This can in turn help your hotel to understand (and serve) your guests better.2. Media-sharing networksThese networks focus almost exclusively on content. YouTube and TikTok are great examples of video-focused media-sharing networks while Instagram is a platform that blends both video and imagery. Streaming platforms like Twitch are considered a subset of this category. These platforms allow users to create, curate and share unique content that sparks conversation, helps develop brand identity, or tells a story.So how can media-sharing sites help your hotel?Create desire:Image-sharing sites in particular are a gift for the visually-weighted travel and hospitality industry. Travel is an emotive experience, and compelling and beautiful imagery and video will help transport your potential guests to the holiday of their dreams and make them more likely to book with you in the process.Encourage user-generated content:People tend to trust those like them, or those they know over the word of a business, So rather than telling people how great your hotel is, you can use user-generated content to show potential guests.Engage:As with social networking sites, the comments section of your posts offers you plenty of opportunities to get to know your potential hotel guests, as well as answer any questions they may have (lowering the barriers to booking in the process).3. Community-based networksThe focus of this type of social network is in-depth discussion, much like a blog forum. Users leave prompts for discussion that spiral into detailed comment threads. Communities often form around select topics like ‘travel’, ‘food’, or even a local sports team. These platforms are specifically designed to spark a conversation, with anyone free to ask a question or engage in a debate around a topic. Sites like Reddit and Quora are great examples of a community-based network.So how can community-based sites help your hotel?Research:Sites like Reddit are a great place to conduct research and find out what your potential customers are really thinking. Reddit is made up of different sub-communities that are built around a specific topic and with a bit of research, you can find one that is relevant to your hotel (or may have even been created specifically about it). You can then discover what people are saying and what questions they have, and use this as a starting point for your content marketing strategy.Answer questions:Reddit and Quora users ask all sorts of questions. Answering them can help build trust and establish you as a thought leader, driving more traffic to your hotel website in the process.4. Review board networksLove them or loathe them, anyone with a hotel will probably be familiar with sites like TripAdvisor or Yelp. With these networks, the focus is on a review, usually of a product or service. For example, on TripAdvisor, users can write reviews on hotels or restaurants and endorse each other's reviews to boost visibility. This, in turn, eliminates a lot of the guesswork that goes into booking a restaurant or hotel and can lead to more bookings depending on what's being said about you.So how can review board networks help your hotel?Understand your customer’s perspective:Reviews tell us about the guest experience from their own point of view. Use this to identify what’s working at your hotel and discover areas with room for improvement.Solve problems:Reviews are also an opportunity to engage with guests and solve any potential challenges before they become a huge deal. By being responsive you have an opportunity to shape people's opinions about your hotel and better manage your reputation. Remember - people will be saying things about your hotel - whether or not you choose to engage with these platforms.Why these social platforms matter:Hotels, like other businesses, use social media applications to market their products and services and track and respond to, customer feedback and concerns. Think of it like an electronic version of word-of-mouth.What makes social media unique is that it is both broad and relatively uncensored. Anyone with internet access can sign up for a social media account. They can use that account to share whatever content they choose to, and the content they share reaches anyone who visits their page or profile.Hotel guests are the perfect target for social media marketing, but it can be a bit of a double-edged sword for hotels. People like to share their experiences – especially while on holiday. Research has revealed that 76% of travellers use social media to do so. Platforms like Facebook and Pinterest have become the place to share holiday snaps, tell friends and family about the amazing service they received at a hotel, or express their disappointment with the food at the hotel restaurant. A stream of 5-star reviews and a social media feed full of eye-catching photos of a hotel destination can drive bookings. However, the opposite is also true. That is why it is crucial to constantly monitor your social channels and respond to feedback in a timely manner.In summary:Social media is a pervasive and powerful tool.Businesses of all sizes and types – including your competitors use it to expand their visibility, market their products and services, and engage with customers.People are talking about your hotel – even if you’re not present.Hotels that correctly use social media can drive bookings.It's important to constantly be ‘on top’ of your social media activity – monitoring and engaging with your customers where they are present.What to do next:Put yourself in your customer's shoes– if you wanted to share your experience of your hotel stay, where would you go? That’s where you need to be present.Search for reviews of your hotel on various social media platforms– they should be visible even if you don’t have a profile. Hashtags are a good place to start.Review your marketing strategyand think about how social media can help amplify it.If you haven't yet,read the first part of our Social Media 101 seriesand follow us on LinkedIn to make sure you don't miss the next one!Join me next week when we explore what is social media and the four main categories of social media platforms.\"],\n",

ECDB reveals the biggest names and their latest growth strategies, backed by data.October 25, 2024DownloadComing soonShareTopicsAlibaba,Amazon,MercadoLibre,Pinduoduo,Top CompaniesMost Valuable eCommerce Companies 2024: Key InsightsAmazon Leads:Amazon continues to dominate eCommerce with a market cap nearing US$2 trillion, driven by strong growth in AWS despite increasing investments in AI and rising operational expenses.Alibaba’s Struggles:Alibaba faces challenges in its core China market due to consumer spending declines, but its international eCommerce and cloud divisions show solid growth, highlighting global potential.Other Players:Pinduoduo, Meituan, and MercadoLibre each hold key positions in their respective markets, with Pinduoduo facing economic pressures, Meituan expanding beyond food delivery, and MercadoLibre boosting revenue by 48% year-over-year.In 2024, eCommerce giants reach valuations rivaling entire economies. This is led by Amazon’s nearly US$2 trillion market cap, a benchmark of influence in global retail.Following Amazon, companies like Alibaba, Pinduoduo, Meituan, and MercadoLibre push boundaries in their own regions. Each of these companies implement strategies to secure their positions in an increasingly competitive space.Here are the top 5 most valuable eCommerce companies by market cap in 2024.Top eCommerce Companies by Market CapThe ranking of the top 5 eCommerce companies by companiesmarketcap.com currently includes players from the U.S., China and Argentina:The undisputed number 1 is, of course, the U.S. eCommerce giant Amazon at almost US$2 trillion in value.Alibaba follows at a distance, valued at US$240 billion.Top 5 is rounded out by Pinduoduo, Meituan and MercadoLibre with market caps ranging between US$104-170 billion.To understand what makes these companies so valuable and influential, we will now take a detailed look at thetop 5 eCommerce companies by market cap.1. AmazonAmazonremains the world’s largest eCommerce player with a market cap nearing US$2 trillion, driven largely by its high-margin segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Q2 2024 saw operating income nearly double year-over-year to US$14.7 billion, largely due to AWS's growth of 19%, surpassing expectations. However, AWS operating margins fell from 37.6% to 35.5%, reflecting the weight of investments in AI and cloud infrastructure.Looking to Q3, Amazon projects US$154-158 billion in revenue, indicating slower growth but sustained profitability. Despite a 54% increase in capital expenses, primarily for AI-driven projects, Amazon is working to offset costs with operational improvements in other areas. Advertising saw 20% growth, and cost-efficient measures across consumer services are expected to contribute to stable profits.AWS accounts for two-thirds of Amazon’s profit, making it the focal point as Amazon navigates rising expenses. With strategic investment in key areas, Amazon remains well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory while adapting to market expectations.Like this insight?It is based on our regularly updated rankings.

Ourproduct category rankingsandbenchmarksallow you to see where various businesses are currently evolving. This information can aid in your decision-making, whether you are a business developer, shop owner, or CEO of a large eCommerce brand. Stay a step ahead of the market with ECDB.2. AlibabaAlibabaranks as the second most valuable eCommerce company, valued at US$240 billion. Recently, the company’s Q2 2024 results fell short of revenue expectations at US$34 billion, affected by sluggish demand in its core China eCommerce segment due to cautious consumer behavior and increased competition from rivals like JD.com and PDD. Despite these challenges, Alibaba’s international eCommerce arm, driven by platforms such as Lazada and AliExpress, saw a robust 32% year-on-year growth.China commerce retail makes up almost half of the company's revenue:China commerce retailaccounted for46%of Alibaba’s revenue in 2023.Cloud computing, international commerce retail, and Cainiao logisticseach contributed11%.Whilelocal consumer servicesis at 6%, this is followed byChina commerce wholesale,international commerce wholesale, anddigital media and entertainment, all at 2%.A strategic priority is the revitalization of Taobao and Tmall, focusing on third-party merchants to lessen dependence on direct sales. Alibaba’s cloud segment has also accelerated, posting 6% growth and achieving its fastest quarterly rate since 2022. This unit benefits from rising demand for Alibaba’s AI-related cloud services, with AI-driven products showing triple-digit growth. The cloud division’s EBITA surged by 155% year-on-year, underscoring its potential as a key profitability driver despite Alibaba's overall revenue pressures.3. PinduoduoPinduoduo, ranked third with a market cap of US$170 billion, reported a disappointing Q2 2024,missing revenue expectationswith US$13.64 billion, below the forecast US$14 billion. The company faced a 15% drop in shares due to challenges from reduced consumer spending in China and rising competition from platforms like JD.com and Temu.Operating expenses surged 48%, driven by increased marketing and promotional efforts, highlighting PDD's struggle to maintain its competitive edge through discounts. Pinduoduo’s core strength remains its low-cost model, attracting budget-conscious shoppers, but ongoing economic challenges in China are impacting growth.Additionally, Pinduoduo generates most of its gross merchandise volume (GMV) from fashion, with electronics and personal care products also significant contributors. The company plans to invest heavily in platform safety and high-quality merchants, which might pressure profitability in the near term as it seeks to improve its overall ecosystem.4. MeituanMeituan, ranked fourth with a market cap of US$150 billion, reportedstrong Q2 2024 results, with revenue rising by 21% to US$11.5 billion and profits jumping 142%. This growth was driven by Meituan's strategic investments and expansion into services like Meituan Instashopping, which offers rapid delivery of various goods beyond food.However, despite financial gains, Meituan's brand value dropped from a peak of US$11.9 billion in 2022 to a projected US$8.5 billion in 2024. Meituan's recent partnerships with brands like Midea, LEGO, and Apple resellers aim to diversify its product offerings and strengthen its competitive position against Alibaba's Ele.me and ByteDance's Douyin.This strategic shift is part of the company's broader effort to convert food delivery customers into buyers across its ecosystem. The core local commerce segment, covering food delivery and travel, remains a crucial growth driver, contributing 60.7 billion yuan (US$8.5 billion) in Q2 revenue.5. MercadoLibreMercadoLibre, holding fifth place with a market cap of US$104 billion, delivered a strong Q2 2024 performance, beating expectations with earnings of US$10.48 per share, surpassing the consensus estimate of US$8.72. The company’s revenue reached US$5.07 billion, marking a 48% year-on-year increase. This result reflects MercadoLibre’s consistent outperformance, as it has exceeded revenue estimates four times in the last four quarters.As we covered in our deep dive on theeCommerce companies worth considering for stock traders, the company’s core strengths continue to be its online marketplace and payments system in Latin America. With a focus on improving operational efficiency, MercadoLibre remains well-positioned for growth despite challenging macroeconomic conditions in the region.Top eCommerce Companies: Wrap-UpDespiterecent questionsabout Amazon's viability, the U.S. eCommerce leader remains on top of all the others in terms of market cap, which reflects consumer sentiment and investor confidence.The fact that the following eCommerce companies on the list operate two of China'slargest marketplacesis certainly no coincidence. Rather, their favorable positioning demonstrates the enormous reach and profitability of thebusiness modelwhen applied correctly.As the distance between the bottom ranks is shrinking, it will be interesting to see which emerging players will make the list the next time. AreTemuandSheinworthy of the top spots?FAQs: Top eCommerce Companies by Market CapWhat does market capitalization mean?Market capitalization, or market cap, is the overall value of all a company's shares. Market cap matters because it helps investors seehow big one company iscompared to another.How is market cap calculated?To calculate market cap, multiply the price of one share of a company by its total number of shares. For instance, if a company has 20 million shares priced at US$50 each, its market cap would be US$1 billion. Here is the formula: Market Cap = Current Price of a Share * Total Number of Shares.How does market cap differ from market value?As explained above, market capitalization shows the value of a company's share. On the other hand, market value is a more complex indicator, although it is often used interchangeably to market cap for evaluating a company's worth. The latter indicator considers several factors including return-to-equity, price-to-earnings, and price-to-sales.Sources:Companiesmarketcap.com, Yahoo!

       "   'Less than a generation ago, e-commerce was only in its infancy, born on the World Wide Web as a vision of entrepreneurs such as Jeff Bezos. Today, e-commerce accounts for almost $1.2 trillion in annual retail sales in the U.S., or 16% of the totalretail industry, and it\\'s returned to growth after a lull following the pandemic. Globally, it\\'s worth more than $5 trillion, led by companies such asAmazon(AMZN2.39%) and China’sAlibaba Group(BABA3.26%), plusbrick-and-mortar retailerssuch asHome Depot(HD0.01%). The tremendous growth ine-commercehas propelled a number of big winners on the stock market, but there\\'s still plenty of opportunity left in online retail. Annual e-commerce sales grew about 15% in the 2010s, and the adoption of online shopping accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. After the pandemic surge, the share of e-commerce sales actually fell through the beginning of 2022, but it has steadily rebounded since then. Growth has slowed as spending patterns normalize following a shift back to brick-and-mortar stores and services such as travel and restaurants. Still, there\\'s plenty of long-term growth left in e-commerce. If you\\'re looking for a list of the top e-commerce companies in the world, keep reading below. For most American investors and consumers, Amazon is the first and last name in e-commerce. The company has essentially defined the space, launching in 1995 as an online bookseller before expanding into myriad other categories over the years. Its marketplace now has a whopping 350 million stock keeping units (SKUs), or unique items, for sale. Without a direct e-commerce competitor in the U.S., Amazon has grown rapidly throughout its history, and innovations, such as its third-party marketplace (Fulfillment by Amazon) and Amazon Prime, have been key to its growth. The company has also built competitive advantages throughreal estate, opening a network of more than 100 fulfillment centers in the U.S. Today, Amazon is by far the largest e-commerce company in the world in terms of revenue. It\\'s even challengingWalmart(WMT0.7%) to be the biggest company in the world in terms ofrevenueand will likely soon pass the retail giant in that category. Amazon finished 2023 with $575 billion in revenue, which was behind Walmart at $611 billion -- but Amazon has historically grown faster. Thanks to its third-party marketplace, which now makes up the majority of sales on its site, Amazon has a larger gross merchandise volume (GMV) than Walmart, but it trails Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in that category. Amazon has also built one of the world\\'s largest cloud infrastructure services, which has become the primary profit engine for the company. Together, the e-commerce andcloud computingbusinesses create a massive set ofcompetitive advantagesfor the company and should lead to continued outperformance for a stock that is up more than 100,000% since its 1997initial public offering(IPO). While Amazon\\'s growth has slowed from its pre-pandemic days, it\\'s still steadily growing and its competitive advantage will make it difficult to slow down. Shopifyhas emerged in the past few years as Amazon\\'s greatest competitor. Thesoftware-as-a-service(SaaS) company didn\\'t do it by challenging Amazon directly in online retail or even by building an e-commerce marketplace. Instead, it\\'s established itself as the tech infrastructure supporting more than 2 million merchants around the world, operations that range from mom-and-pop businesses to global brand giants such asKraft Heinz(KHC1.04%). Shopify provides all the tools that any company needs to run an e-commerce business, including everything from website building and a mobile app to services such as marketing, payment processing, financial tracking, and even loans. The company is the clear leader in e-commerce software; Amazon pulled the plug on its competitor product, Amazon Webstore, after recognizing that it couldn\\'t catch Shopify. More recently, Amazon launched \"Buy with Prime,\" allowing independent e-commerce sites, including Shopify sellers, to ship through Amazon Prime. However, Shopify has since integrated with Buy with Prime, showing that the new platform can work for both companies. The Amazon rivalry has helped define Shopify.CEOTobi Lutke likes to call the company\\'s strategy \"arming the rebels,\" and that\\'s helped drive exponential growth for Shopify from $389 million in revenue in 2016 to $7.1 billion in 2023. Profitability has also improved as the business has scaled up, just as it should with a SaaS business. Shopify stock crashed in 2022 along with other high-pricedtech stocks, but its recouped much of those losses as the business continues to grow and the company is now steadily profitable again. Coupang is South Korea\\'s leading e-commerce company, and operating in South Korea comes with a number of advantages. First, South Korea is one of the most densely populated countries in the developed world, which creates efficiencies for e-commerce providers like Coupang as delivery distances from distribution centers are much shorter, making it easier to achieve fast delivery. Additionally, South Korea\\'s smaller size has helped give it one of the fastest internet networks in the world since it needs to cover much less ground than it would in the U.S. Coupang has grown steadily by following a similar strategy to Amazon, selling goods both directly and through a third-party marketplace. It\\'s also launched a membership program similar to Amazon Prime called Rocket WOW. Additionally, Coupang has smaller growth businesses under its developing offerings segment, like food delivery, digital payments, mobile games, and Farfetch, the online fashion luxury platform it acquired in early 2024. Coupang reported 18% revenue growth in 2023 to $24.4 billion, but its margins are improving, and its investments in complementary online businesses connected through its Rocket Wow membership should pay off over the long run. E-commerce isn’t just a domestic phenomenon. Online shopping has taken offinternationallyas well, and in Latin America, the clear leader isMercadoLibre(MELI-0.06%), which operates in 18 countries in Latin America but makes about half of its revenue in Brazil. MercadoLibre’s primary businesses include an e-commerce marketplace for both third and first-party sales, shipping services through Mercado Envios, and a suite of financial services under the Mercado Pago umbrella, which includes mobile point-of-sale devices,digital walletsfor consumers, and loans through Mercado Credito. In some ways, MercadoLibre resembles a hybrid of Amazon and Shopify, with some of the functions of afintech companysuch asPayPal(PYPL3.25%). The formula has been just as successful in Latin America as in the U.S. For example, Mercado Pago was originally conceived as a tool to help MercadoLibre’s marketplace, but it grew so fast that most payments processed through the service now come from off the MercadoLibre platform, with Mercado Pago essentially functioning as a standalone business. In 2023, the total payment volume on Mercado Pago topped $180 billion, while GMV on the marketplace was about $50 billion. MercadoLibre is growing rapidly, with profitability increasing and revenue up almost 40% to $14.5 billion in 2023. The company has continued to deliver brisk growth in 2024, outperforming its peers in the U.S. Considering that e-commerce in Latin America remains underpenetrated, and the middle class is expanding quickly, MercadoLibre still has a large addressable market ahead that should offer the company many more years of high growth. The streaming industry is rapidly expanding as more companies compete for home entertainment dollars. No matter what the economy, we always need these products. High-end products that people want, not need, make up this sector. We all go shopping. These companies provide the goods we buy across industries. E-commerce stocks offer a lot of upside potential for investors, but they come with risks. Many e-commerce companies aren’t profitable, and even the ones that are profitable generally have only minimal profits. The hangover in the sector from the pandemic recovery has abated, but the sector is unlikely to return to its pre-pandemic growth rate as a whole. Investors should be aware that e-commerce is riskier than moststock market sectors, but the track record of these stocks shows that just one successful e-commerce stock can deliver life-changing returns.

What is surprising is thatamazon.com’s year-over-year visitsare down 3.51%, while their month-over-month (MoM) visits are up 4.38%. Even with some fluctuation, the total visits landed at 2.3B — not bad, if we can say so.Even with some fluctuation, amazon.com maintains a solid brand presence and effectiveSEO strategy; its largest traffic source wasdirect, with 1.2B visits, followed by organic search, with 585.9M visits.Although we see a bit of a dip in January and February, we also see a steady increase in March, April, and May – which can be attributed to holidays like St. Patrick’s Day, Easter, and Passover, to name a few. As shoppers head to Amazon for their typical online shopping,we see an uptick of 86% on desktop and 51% on mobile when it comes to Visit Duration. Most likely, shoppers are spending more time browsing for related items because of the Memorial Day discounts. Who doesn’t love a good deal?As mentioned, direct and organic search led the charge in drivingtraffic to amazon.com. So,what was the world looking for that led them to amazon.com? Short answer: everything. Longer answer: these are the 15 most popular organic keywords for May…Amazon Prime, which takes place in July, and Amazon Kindle-related search terms made up 53% of the top 15. Also in the top 15 is the Amazon-exclusive movie, The Idea of You, and the Amazon-owned ad-supported video-on-demand streaming service, Freevee, indicating a few things:Although Amazon originally started as an online book retailer, it has vastly expanded its offering into a general retailer. Then, it moved forward by offering E-Readers (Kindles), cloud services, and now home entertainment (Freevee, Prime Video, and The Idea of You). With this move, they have come to own the online retail business and continue expanding.What website technologies does the biggest ecommerce company use? Well, here are a few:Audio Video Media:Art19 (installed February 2024), a tool that provides near real-time RSS ad insertion, unlocking regional and international advertising as well as monetization of back catalogsConversion & Analytics:Adobe Analytics (installed January 2024), provides reporting, visualizations, and analysis of Customer Data that allows customers to discover actionable insightsAdvertising:Demdex (installed January 2024), actionable and optimized audience targeting2) Samsung.comThe number two spot goes to samsung.com, who’s traffic has also seen some ups and downs.Compared to May 2023, it saw a decrease of 4.97%, but when compared to April, there’s been an increase of 3.06%. It’s interesting to see that a massive chunk of the traffic comes from mobile devices (96%), indicating that people are looking for phones on their phones, resulting in high direct and organic search traffic.When it comes tosamsung.com’s online channel overview, its biggest driver isorganic traffic, with 419.8M,while itsdirect traffic is 387.7M,followed by its paid search traffic, with 273.2M visits.These are the top 15 non-branded keywords that users were looking for when trying to discover or purchase Samsung products.Our organic search analysis debunks the hypothesis that traffic is primarily mobile due to users searching for accounts or apps related to their device.So, why is the channel traffic for samsung.com skewing so heavily towards mobile?A few possible reasons:Arecent analysisof smartphone usage revealed that “48% of buyers use their smartphones to start searching about the product or service they are interested in.” However, another study found that desktop users had a conversion rate of 4.14% compared to 3.36% for tablet users and 1.53% for smartphone users. To combat this, e-commerce companies can invest infrictionless payment options, shop-the-look features, and fast checkout practices to boost mobile conversion rates.Historically, consumers are more inclined to purchase certain products online than others, with electronics being a common choice. Additionally, the power of impulse shopping should always be considered.Aside from the ‘classic’ insights for Samsung, let’s see what else we can gather from the latest Sales Signals.Firstly, Samsung launched its “AI for All” vision, a roadmap to developing AI. Similarly, Samsung launched the M54 model. Additionally, General Motors partnered with Samsung on May 1, 2024. Samsung also launched its AGI business recently.But that’s not all, folks. Let’s see what are the web technologies this top dog uses:Advertising:Ads Txt (installed June 2024), a tool that helps ensure digital ad inventory is only sold through authorized sellers such as AdSenseConversion & Analytics:Datadog (installed May 2024), a Cloud Monitoring as a Service platform for cloud-scale applications, offering monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and servicesCustomer Relationship:Salesforce (installed March 2024), provides customer relationship management software and applications focused on sales, customer service, marketing automation, e-commerce, analytics, and application development3) Ebay.comAs we continue the upward traffic trend,Ebay.com is up 4.19% in May, with a whopping 708.2M MoM visits and only a 92% YoY increase from last year. Let’s see what’s been going on.Ebay.com’s largest traffic source in May was direct, with 317.9M visits, followed by organic search, with 292.8M visits. Diving into the numbers, the primary device driver for organic traffic is mobile, while for direct traffic, most users come from desktop. What else can we find out here?Checking out the keywords users are searching for, we see thebiggest search term is “ebaymotors,” with a monthly search traffic of 16.9K.A quick visit at ebay.com to put theSimilarwebSales Intelligence Chrome extensionto use. The insights tab of the extension gave us dozens of instantly AI-generated, real-time, actionable insights for ebay.com —our favorite insight for eBay was this one:“Your total Pages Per Visit in May was 6.62, trailing behind Amazon and Mercari, yet ahead of AliExpress and Walmart. You might find it tough to keep visitors engaged compared to some competitors, affecting customer retention.”A simple metric + industry benchmarking = actionable insight that could impact revenue.Tweet thisThis brings us directly to eBay.com’s page views. As we saw earlier, organic’s biggest driver was mobile, and direct’s biggest was desktop. Both mobile and desktop had a nice increase in page views.Desktop saw a steady increase of 3.05%, while mobile increased by 4.44%. Way to go, eBay!How else does this ecommerce rockstar keep the revenue flowing? Here is the most recently installed website technology:Retargeting:Amplitude (installed April 2024), a product analytics and event tracking platformMarketing Automation:Dotomi (installed April 2024), a tool for personalized media display advertising that dynamically adapts in real time at the user and impression levelPayment & Currencies:Venmo (installed February 2024), a popular app for electronically transferring funds between parties4) Aliexpress.comSpot number three goes to aliexpress.com! With580.6M total visits,aliexpress.com’s YoY growthis up 31.72%, and MoM growth is up 6.87%. But there’s more — aliexpress.com is growing faster than the industry average (-0.14%).Aliexpress.com’sbiggest traffic contributor is direct visits (330.7M), followed byorganic search (100.6M). Additionally, a majority of its traffic comes fromdesktop, with 326.7M visits, while mobile brings in 251.7M visits. Unlike eBay.com, which has an almost even split between devices, AliExpress users favor visiting the site from their desktops.Diving deeper into aliexpress.com’straffic & engagement,we see a MoM increase of 0.26% in pages per visit on mobile devices. This raises the question: why is desktop driving more traffic if users spend more time on the site from their mobile devices? But what are users searching for to land on aliexpress.com?Analyzing the keywords users are searching for, it’s clear they focus on tech products. We can see80% of the top 15 searches are for these types of items, such as hand-held gaming devices, computer keyboards, and computer mice.Interestingly, in the last couple of years, Ali Express has invested a lot of time in installing different language options on its platform, including Hebrew, Arabic, Dutch, English, German, French, and more. They’ve been working hard to become a global retailer for all our online shopping needs. Kudos to you, AliExpress!5) Temu.comIs it surprising that Temu made it to the top five after its crazy surge this past year?Temu.com’s MoM and YoY growthhas seen a significant increase — 8.12% (2.855B) and 150.45% (544.2M),respectively. Temu’s visits via geography are:Japan at 17.82%United States at 16.69%Germany at 6.37%German users have also spent the longest duration on temu.com, averaging more than 10 minutes and 21 seconds.The Bounce Rate for temu.com has improved, with more people staying on the site longer than before, extending todesktop (1.67%) and mobile (1.66%).When we check the device usage, there’s nearly a 50-50 split between mobile and desktop. But where does all their traffic come from?It’s no surprise that the majority oftemu.com’s trafficcomes fromdirect search (184.2M),followed bypaid search (166.6M), and organic search (90.4M). Interestingly, direct traffic comes primarily from desktop devices, while paid search has a larger mobile traffic trend. An effective paid search strategy that Temu has leveraged is bidding on branded search terms related to competitors and other retailers —nearly 50% of their top 15 paid keyword terms.Let’s check out the top keywords.A quick visit to temu.com using the Similarweb Sales Intelligence Chrome extension provided interesting insights, including this one:“Your website, temu.com, has more pageviews than several key competitors as of May 2024. Like many businesses, you may find it challenging to fully understand and leverage this web traffic advantage.”What website technologies does this e-commerce giant use?

We have selected premium items from around the world, offering you high-quality options, and are dedicated to providing you with a beautiful life, allowing you to experience all aspects of refined living in one place.”After checking them out further, we see they haven’t yet done much work on their SEO strategy. Instead, they focused onsocial media, which is their biggest traffic provider with 99.49% of total visits, followed by direct with a minor 0.51%. Since social is huge with currentlye.com, the most used device is not surprisingly mobile.Looking at currentlye.com’s trafficand engagement metrics, we see that theirpages per visit increased by 37.27% on mobile in May, leading to a significant growth in visit duration (+1544%). Once consumers land on currentlye.com’s site, they spend more time browsing through more pages.Let’s check out the website technologies used by this fastest-growing global ecommerce site:Document Standard:Canonical Tag (installed August 2023), a tool that is an HTML element that helps webmasters prevent duplicate content issues by specifying the “canonical,” or “preferred” versionPayment & Currencies:JCB (installed May 2023), a Japanese card company, credit card issuer, merchant acquirer, and provider of payment technology solutionsAdvertising:Facebook Advertiser (installed November 2022), the platform for running ads on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger2) Footlocker.phThe runner-up spot goes to footlocker.ph, which sawsignificant growth with 423.61% MoM and 916.67M% YoY, totaling 1.279M visits in May 2024. What was driving this growth?In February 2024,footlocker.ph saw approximately 1.28M visits. Most of this traffic, around1.03M visits, came from organic search, indicating a strong presence in search engine results.direct traffic also contributed significantly, with around 210K visits. Other channels, such as social media, referrals, and email, contributed minimally, with 27.9K, 7.7K, and 353 visits, respectively. Let’s see what’s going on with SEO.Although theAdidas Samba shoeis trendy this year,New Balancesneakers have yet to disappear. This single topicmakes up 53% of the top 15 keywords, with some mentions of Vans and Hoka shoes.When we visit the ‘heart of sneakers’ website, what does Similarweb’s SAM reveal? We see that the average pages per visit benchmark for Footlocker.ph is lower than Shonami but higher than Urban Athletics, Park Outlet, and Commonwealth. Let’s dive deeper into Footlocker.ph’s pages per visit.The average pages per visit (desktop and mobile combined) is 6.23, showing asteady increase from April’s average of 5.17 pages per visit. With the increase in average pages per visit, there is a direct correlation with a positive Bounce Rate improvement (-30.65%). Foot Locker is doing something right with its related products, keeping users on its site.What’s another way to drive organic results? Installing top-notch website technologies that make your ecommerce site operate faster, like those used by hindware.com:Language:English HREF Language (installed June 2023)Advertising:DoubleClick (installed May 2023), a search management platform that enables agencies and advertisers to create, manage, report on, and optimize search campaignsAudio Video Media:Vimeo (installed April 2023), an AI-powered video platform3) Themagic5.comAs we continue down the list of the top five fastest-growing global companies, we reach the third spot with THEMAGIC5.Themagic5.com has seensteady growthMoM (419.56%) and YoY (583.19%), with 1.355M total visits.When checking the traffic by channel,organic search (36.15%) and direct (32.29%) are almost neck and neck. Mobile devices drive a significant portion of visitors (412.4K) compared to desktops (55K). Although mobile is high for all the other companies, we have yet to see a driver this strong.Why are these two channels so close to each other? What keywords are users searching for?After investigating the keywords, we see that even ‘non-branded’ searches still include the brand name. Themagic5.com has strong brand awareness, possibly because the company’s founders appeared on Shark Tank, or their goggles are so well-known. Either way, they know what they’re doing!Whether you’re a big Shark Tank fan or not, this brand pitched its idea on live TV, and regardless of their outcome on the show, these numbers don’t lie.What website technologies does THEMAGIC5 use?

In May 2024, thesite had 1.332M total visits, a 303.41% MoM increase, growing faster than the industry average (-3.13%). Like the other top fastest-growing e-commerce sites, Design Inn is mobile-friendly (100%, in fact).When investigating desiginn.com, we see that80.31% of their traffic was direct, and the other 19.69% came from Social.Unlike some of the other brands we’ve looked at, there is no traffic from organic search. It seems Design Inn is investing more in its social media strategy, like Currentlye.We checked their website and saw that they sell kitchen appliances, so we ran to their social media channels. On Instagram, they have a plethora of products and discounts for customers. As users scroll through their Instagram feed, they’ll land on a Design Inn post, explore their page, and then head to the company’s website to see what other products are offered.From there, we noticed that theaverage Page Views MoM increased by 202% as users browsed more pages on desiginn.com’s site.

The first online sale took place in 1994, when a man sold a Sting CD to a friend through his website, NetMarket, the first online retail platform.Since then, ecommerce as a business model and ecommerce companies have exploded in scope, totally redefining the global retail landscape in the process. Global ecommerce sales areexpected to reach$5 trillion in 2022 and $6 trillion by 2024. In the US, ecommerceaccountsfor more than 13% of total sales.What is ecommerce?Ecommerce, short for “electronic commerce,” is a business model in which products and services are bought and sold over the internet.It also concerns the transfer of money and data that make these transactions possible. Although many consumers associate ecommerce only with products, the term encompasses any and all commercial transactions made possible by the internet—whether it’s buying a sweater from a manufacturer in New Zealand, or hiring a cleaner’s services through Craigslist.Thegrowth of ecommercehas been driven both by digitally native global online marketplaces, like Amazon and Alibaba, as well as traditional brick-and-mortar retailers that have expanded their own ecommerce presence, like Target and Best Buy. While each of these retailers are operationally similar in terms ofecommerce basics, they’ve also carved out their own unique niches in the ecommerce landscape by focusing their product ranges or developing unique fulfillment strategies.10 top ecommerce companiesShopifyAmazoneBayEtsyCraigslistMetaWalmartTargetBest BuyAlibaba1.

Founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995 as an online auction site, eBay is one of the standout survivors of the late early 2000s dot-com bubble—a stock market crash caused by excessive over-speculation of online companies in the late 1990s.Today, eBay is a multibillion-dollar ecommerce business that facilitates both consumer-to-consumer sales on a best-offer basis as well as traditional priced-as-is sales. The site is free to use for buyers, but sellers are charged a fee for listing items. eBay’s annual net revenue was about$9.8 billion in 2022, a decrease from the $10.4 billion reported for the year prior.4.

Craig Newmark, the list’s namesake, started the company in 1995 as an email Listserv for friends focusing on events in the San Francisco Bay Area. That Listserv morphed into a website in 1996 and has since expanded into other advertising and sales categories.Craigslist now covers metropolitan areas in more than 70 countries and draws about191.6 million visits a month.6. MetaWith Meta, you can sell on both Facebook and Instagram.Meta Platforms, formerly known asFacebook, is a US multinational technology company based in Menlo Park, California. The company is most famous as the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.It also operates Facebook Marketplace, which functions similarly to Craigslist in terms of offering consumer-to-consumer sales and gig services, and ecommerce functionality for shops on Facebook and Instagram, which allows users to click through on Instagram posts to purchase featured products. Meta generated an estimated$116 billion in revenue for 2022.7.

It has stores in all 50 US states and a significant presence (both physical and digital) in Canada and Mexico as well.Walmart has leveraged its brick-and-mortar footprint toward a successful ecommerce model by using existing stores aswarehousesfor online orders—customers can buy items off the store shelf through Walmart.com, as opposed to off the shelf of a single warehouse located hundreds or thousands of miles away.

Target delivered about$109 billion in revenuein 2022 and enjoys more than154.7 million visits a month.9. Best BuyMerchants that want to sell via the Best Buy website must apply through Best Buy Marketplace.Best Buy is a US multinational consumer electronics retailer based in Minnesota.

Schulze and James Wheeler in 1966 as a stereo store called Sound of Music, it rebranded under its current name to sell a wider range of electronics in 1983.In addition to its brick-and-mortar retail stores, Best Buy operates a robust ecommerce service through its website, BestBuy.com.

Its consumer-facing site,AliExpress, has an average of431 million visits.Choosing the best ecommerce companiesWhile the ecommerce landscape has undeniably been shaped by the growth of massive ecommerce companies like Amazon and Alibaba, there’s still ample space for online stores to leverage the model and make names for themselves.If you’re considering adding ecommerce functionality to your small business, or starting a digitally native ecommerce venture from scratch, here are some questions you may want to consider:Do you have a website or the means to design one (eitherusing a website builderor with a web developer)?If you already have a website, can it be used as is to launch an ecommerce arm, or will you need a redesign?What ecommerce platforms are best suited for your business format: Are you business-to-consumer, business-to-business, etc.?What traffic goals would your ecommerce arm need to meet in order to make the investment worth it?Beyond simply the best online store builder, think about the other business tools those platforms offer. It’s often beneficial to use a seamlessly integrated ecosystem, consisting of your online store, payment processor, POS, and even small business lender. Shopify, for example, has an entire suite of tools that help you manage every aspect of your business, and an App Store with more than 4,000 apps to help you customize the experience for your customers and your team.Selling online with your own ecommerce website has never been easier, faster, or more scalable. Shopify is a single platform that lets you sell wherever your customers are—online, in-person, and everywhere in between.Read moreWhat is Shopify and How Does it Work?8 Dropshipping Software for New DropshippersHow To Write a Return Policy (+ Free Template) (2024)Top Wholesale Marketplaces to Sell Your Products (2024)How to Avoid Burnout As an EntrepreneurWhat is Ecommerce Website Development?
