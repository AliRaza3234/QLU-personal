      "a Restructures Reality Labs Into 'Wearables' And 'Metaverse' Divisions]( by In an effort to further expand its software platform, Meta is restructuring Reality Labs by merging all its virtual-reality teams into two divisions one focused on the Quest VR headset line and another group dedicated to the development of other Meta hardware products. The change will result in some layoffs, according to the Verge, which obtained an internal memo written by Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth. \"With Quest 3 bringing [mixed reality] into the mainstream, we have finally gotten to a place where we feel like all the major components are in place for us to grow our software platform consistently,\" wrote Bosworth adding that the company is \"deeply committed to investing in Horizon as the core foundation of our social, spatial Horizon OS, and high-quality experiences for both mixed reality and mobile.\" By dividing Reality labs into \"Wearables\" and \"Metaverse,\" led by the company's Vice President of Metaverse Technologies Vishal Shah, Bosworth feels that Meta will be able to create \"more integrated product experiences across hardware, software, and experiences with less friction and fragmentation.\" The decision for Meta to create a dedicated \"Wearables\" department separate from the teams focused on its metaverse gaming and hardware products is partly attributable to its , which Bosworth says are \"a much bigger hit than we anticipated.\" \"We are doubling down on finding a strong product market fit for wearable Meta AI, building a business around it, and expanding the audience,\" Bosworth wrote in the memo. \"Our north star to overlay digital content seamlessly onto the physical world remains the same, but the steps on that path just got a lot more exciting.\" The restructuring, which marks the biggest shakeup of Meta's hardware division since it was renamed Reality Labs during the company's rebranding to a metaverse-focused social media company in 2020, is also likely an attempt to quell investor concerns.

      "The Apple Vision Pro (Miguel Candela/Getty Images) # Meta's wearables keep winning while Apple's Vision Pro struggles Apple is scaling back its Vision Pro production, while Meta's Ray-Bans continue to sell out. [Jack Raines]( 10/24/24 2:51PM It's a tale of two headlines in the wearable-technology game. On Wednesday, The Information that Apple has \"sharply scaled back its Vision Pro production since the early summer,\" and the company could stop making its existing version by year-end. The reason: few people are buying the $3,500 headset. After a splashy February 2024 launch, interest in the Vision Pro evaporated. Counterpoint Research noted that Vision Pro sales plunged 80% from Q1 to Q2 2024, and the released for the Vision Pro dropped from 300 in February to 89 in March, declining every month since. Supply-chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also in April that Apple had cut its 2024 Vision Pro shipments to 400,000 to 450,000 units, after the company had initially projected to sell 700,000 to 800,000 units or more. Meta, meanwhile, has been crushing the wearable-tech game. Counterpoint Research reported that Meta had a",

The discussion centered around recent developments from tech giants Meta and Apple, highlighting the potential and challenges of this emerging technology. **Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses: A Step in the Right Direction?** Leo Laporte kicked off the conversation by praising Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which he wore during the podcast. These glasses look like regular eyewear and have been selling well due to their discreet design. Parmy Olson emphasized the importance of aesthetics in wearable tech, noting that Meta's success stems from creating glasses that \"don't look like tech glasses\" and avoid making users \"look nerdy and awful.\" The panel agreed that Meta's approach of starting simple and gradually adding features is a smart strategy. This contrasts with Apple's Vision Pro, which the group perceived as potentially overreaching. **Apple's Vision Pro: Too Much, Too Soon?** The discussion turned critical when Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset was discussed. Leo Laporte expressed skepticism about the $3,500 price point and questioned whether consumers are ready to \"strap a heavy computer on their face.\" Daniel Rubino suggested that Apple might have approached product development from the wrong end, cramming in every imaginable feature instead of starting simple and building up. Parmy Olson noted the peculiarity of Apple's strategy, given that they typically start with a basic",

      "twatches, wireless earphones and Apple's place in all of this._ Business ### The Story Wearables have changed the way we interact with technology. Fitness trackers, smartwatches, wireless headphones These were items that were once fashionable only among a select group of people. Today, however, they have gained mainstream acceptance. And for tech companies, this is a moment of reckoning. Because \"wearables\" isn't just a fringe domain anymore. It's a multi-billion dollar industry rife for disruption. Think about it There was a time when smartphones made all the money. But today, they're just commodities. You can't tell one phone from another. And the market seems to be saturating. But people are only just getting into wearables and that means the growth potential is huge right now. However, one company seems to be dominating everyone else. And it's the usual suspect Apple. Apple is miles ahead of everyone else. So far in the first quarter of 2021, Apple has had a global market share of followed by Samsung which only has an 11% share to its name. Then we have Xiaomi with 9.7%, Huawei with 8.2% and finally, India's BoAt makes an appearance with a respectable 2.9% market share. In fact, some estimates suggest that the wearables segment at Apple alone could be worth a mammoth . If this division was spun off as a different entity, it would feature amongst the Fortune 100 companies. And it's not like this happened overnight. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a result of careful planning and an unparalleled understanding of human psychology. Unlike phones, wearables have to be worn. And people must crave to show them off. It's a style statement, and if you can't fashion something that fits this criterion, then that's a no-go. Apple has nailed this aspect. When Apple introduced the Apple Watch, there was considerable scepticism about the utility of such a product. Some critics even lambasted the first generation for being a let-down. But ask yourself this Why do people we",

SINGAPORE More intimate healthcare and fitness uses are coming up on consumers' wrists as smartwatch makers cosy up to their wallets. The wearables market, which smartwatches dominate, is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of at least 4 per cent until 2027, said market researcher Canalys. In the first half of 2023, 86 million units of wearables had already been shipped globally. More than 180 million wearables were shipped worldwide in 2022, most of which were some form of smartwatch, said Canalys. Healthcare and fitness uses in smartwatches in recent times have catapulted the popularity of these devices. They are an extension of the mobile phone and monitor a plethora of readings, from a user's heart rate to his location and even how well he sleeps. Wearables are appealing because they offer personalised readings of the user's health, said Professor Lim C",

      "ften seen its market cap fall victim to its sales success. While the popularity of products such as the iPhone, Mac and iPads propelled Apple to new heights, whenever sales appeared to slow its market capitalization suffered. By contrast, Microsoft built itself into one of the world's largest companies with a focus on steady recurring revenue streams. You might not need a new smartphone or laptop every year, but a software license, cloud-computing package or video game subscription means ongoing paymentsand client stickiness. Then Apple started borrowing from Microsoft's playbook: it launched news and games subscriptions, a video streaming service, and even its own credit card. Once Apple moved beyond hardware to software and services, its revenue growth became unstoppable. On January 3, 2022, Apple became the first company ever to surpass $3 trillion in market value, and it is still the world's largest today. ## Market Cap Leaders Change With The Times Today, most of the top 10 companies by market capitalization are technology firms. Until a decade ago, many of the most valuable firms were traditional long-standing blue-chip industrial behemoths like Exxon, Chevron, General Electric or AT&T. This is not to say that traditional sectors have lost all their appeal. Saudi Aramco continues to rank in the top 10, and Exxon, another oil giant, is hanging on in the top 20. Finance and healthcare are also represented. Berkshire Hathaway leads with a market value of over $1 trillion; Visa and Mastercard make the top 20 with a market cap of about $500 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. healthcare companies UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly, and Denmark's Novo Nordisk are also in the top 20. Yet, more often than not, the biggest companies by stock market valuation tend to be tech firms, even if they make things (Tesla) or sell things (Amazon)not only that, rather than being a one-time purchase, these physical objects can often continue to generate steady and predictable revenue streams over long periods of time.

It's lovely to be back, and I'm excited to chat about what's going on with private companies, public markets and the space between the two. I wonder what the average revenue (trailing, say) of a unicorn is today, and if that figure is higher or lower than it was a year ago or three years ago. There's a lot of wiggle room in the question; on one hand, the average age of a unicorn has likely gone up, as there are far more born over time than exist in the cohort.

      "ften seen its market cap fall victim to its sales success. While the popularity of products such as the iPhone, Mac and iPads propelled Apple to new heights, whenever sales appeared to slow its market capitalization suffered. By contrast, Microsoft built itself into one of the world's largest companies with a focus on steady recurring revenue streams. You might not need a new smartphone or laptop every year, but a software license, cloud-computing package or video game subscription means ongoing paymentsand client stickiness. Then Apple started borrowing from Microsoft's playbook: it launched news and games subscriptions, a video streaming service, and even its own credit card. Once Apple moved beyond hardware to software and services, its revenue growth became unstoppable. On January 3, 2022, Apple became the first company ever to surpass $3 trillion in market value, and it is still the world's largest today. ## Market Cap Leaders Change With The Times Today, most of the top 10 companies by market capitalization are technology firms. Until a decade ago, many of the most valuable firms were traditional long-standing blue-chip industrial behemoths like Exxon, Chevron, General Electric or AT&T. This is not to say that traditional sectors have lost all their appeal. Saudi Aramco continues to rank in the top 10, and Exxon, another oil giant, is hanging on in the top 20. Finance and healthcare are also represented. Berkshire Hathaway leads with a market value of over $1 trillion; Visa and Mastercard make the top 20 with a market cap of about $500 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. healthcare companies UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly, and Denmark's Novo Nordisk are also in the top 20. Yet, more often than not, the biggest companies by stock market valuation tend to be tech firms, even if they make things (Tesla) or sell things (Amazon)not only that, rather than being a one-time purchase, these physical objects can often continue to generate steady and predictable revenue streams over long periods of time.

Our annual Best Under A Billion list of 200 small and midsized publicly traded companies, with sales under $1 billion, bears testimony to that economic resilience.

The rebound in consumer spending also contributed to a renewed glow in the beauty business, with nine related companies making the cut.

Tesla's cash flow is also all over the place as it spends heavily on building new factories and increasing production and shortfalls often have to be plugged by fresh [sales]( of shares or debt, both of which impact the company's per-share valuation.

The company, which historically has been unable to keep up with demand, has seen its order backlog shrink from **476,000** units in July 2022, to **74,000** in December 2022.

      "it-comparison-2010-2024/< > [Featured Blogs]( > Amazon Vs. Walmart: Revenue And Profit Comparison, 20102024 Walmart is the largest US retailer overall, while Amazon dominates online retail. Over the past several years, Amazon's revenue growth has significantly outpaced Walmart's, and its profits have also surged. To understand the factors behind these trends, we analyzed their revenues and profits across business segments, geographic regions, and product/service categories. **NOTE:** For our analysis, we examined the most recent annual financials of both companies. Amazon's fiscal year (FY) ends in December, meaning its 2023 revenues represent the 12 months ending on December 31, 2023. Walmart's fiscal year ends in January, so its FY24 revenues correspond to the 12 months ending on January 31, 2024. Since 11 of those 12 months fall within 2023, we compared Walmart's FY24 revenues with Amazon's 2023 revenues. Following are three select insights from our analysis: 1. **Amazon's growth far outpaces Walmart and the retail sector.** Amazon annual revenues reached $575 billion in 2023, and Walmart total revenues reached $648 billion. Over the last five years (20182023), Amazon achieved a cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20%, significantly outpacing both Walmart's 5% growth and the 7% growth in total US retail sales (excluding auto and gas). Extending the analysis to a 13-year period (20102023), Amazon's CAGR stood at an impressive 24%, compared to 3% for Walmart and 5% for the broader US retail industry. **In Q4 2024, Amazon's quarterly revenues could surpass Walmart's for the first time.** For context, in Q1 2010, Amazon's quarterly revenues were a modest $7 billion compared to Walmart's $100 billion. Over the next decade, however, Amazon experienced rapid growth, fueled by its expansion into new markets and s",
      "Advertisement ![]( Amazon's revenue grew nearly 44 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, topping $100bn for the first time [File: Bloomberg] By Ryan VlastelicaBloomberg Published On 3 Feb 20213 Feb 2021 Save articles to read later and create your own reading list.Close Tooltip Amazon.com Inc. breached the $1 billion-a-day revenue mark in 2020, in another example of how the company's massive growth and market dominance has made its stock a near-unanimous favorite on Wall Street. The e-commerce giant's fourth-quarter results brought full-year revenue to $386 billion. According to an analysis of Bloomberg data, Walmart Inc. is the only other U.S. company with a $1 billion daily sales average, though Exxon Mobil has hit it in the past. Amazon's massive haul reflects both the holiday shopping season and the pandemic, which accelerated a longstanding shift to online retail over last year. As a measure of how the company is thriving in this environment, revenue grew nearly 44% in the fourth quarter, topping $100 billion for the first time; it also guided toward another quarter above that level.

But beginning around the 1990s, the company began to shift its focus toward computer services and software. It sold off hardware businesses such as flat-panel displays, disk drives, and personal computers, and began acquiring services and software companies.4 In recent years, the company has set its sights on becoming a leader in cloud computing, a strategic push underscored by its 2019 acquisition of Red Hat Inc.5 To facilitate this shift toward cloud services and [artificial intelligence]( (AI), IBM spun off its infrastructure management business in 2021.

Rockefeller and others in 1870. In 1911, as a result of a decision by the Supreme Court, the company broke up into separate and smaller companies. Among them was Jersey Standard and the Vacuum Oil Company (which would produce Mobiloil). In 1966, Mobil became the Mobil Oil Company. In 1972, Jersey Standard became Exxon Corporation. And finally, in 1999, Exxon and Mobil merged. The company, ExxonMobil, is headquartered in Houston, Texas. Darren Wood is the company's CEO and President. He is also chairman of the board of directors. Wood has been with ExxonMobil since 1992. His 30 years of industry experience involved various senior leadership roles and the management of safety-critical operations. ## Recent Developments **** In May 2024, ExxonMobil announced its plans to enter the lithium supply business.

      "edicine-makers. Many of these investors simultaneously hold stakes in more than one large pharmaceutical company and their generic counterparts, something known as \"common ownership\". This has raised concern that it undermines competition and as a result consumers end up paying more. A recent co-authored by researchers Albert Banal-Estanol, Melissa Newham and Jo Seldeslachts for DIW Berlin found that large pharmaceutical companies have become connected to each other through their shareholders. \"Public companies are increasingly owned by a handful of large institutional investors so we expected to see many ownership links between companies what was more surprising was the magnitude of common ownership,\" the authors told _TRT World_ in an emailed response. \"We frequently find that more than 50 percent of a company is owned by 'common' shareholders who also own stakes in rival pharma companies.\" For instance in 2014, the same investors collectively owned half the shares of Switzerland-based Novartis and Germany's Bayer, the maker of Aspirin. TRTWorld Things haven't changed much since then. The three largest shareholders of Pfizer, J&J and Merck are Vanguard, SSGA and BlackRock, the multi-trillion dollar funds which make investments on behalf of their clients and keep a cut for their service. What institutional investors do is perfectly legal. They are not even reviewed by competition authorities as long as an investor such as BlackRock keeps its shareholding at less than 10 percent in a pharma firm. They are classified as passive investors. \"The concern is how passive are they?\" the DIW Berlin report authors said. Institutional investors may not directly interfere in a pharma company's day-to-day business. But knowing who the shareholders are and their stake in rival companies, the pharma executives can end up working in the interest of common institutional investors, they said. \"The increase in connectivity between brand firms (such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca) may also affect drug prices. This is because economic theory clearly indicates that intense price competition between firms that share the same owner, ultimat",

      "# A Comprehensive Look at Various Categories of Social Media Platforms by [Pepper]( \"Posts by Pepper\") | May 3, 2023 | [Marketing]( Social media has become an integral part of modern culture, allowing people to interact with one another and keep up to date on the latest news and trends. The sheer number of various platforms available can be overwhelming but understanding the different categories of social media platforms can help you make sense of it all! In this blog post, we'll take a comprehensive look at several key types of social media networking options in order to determine which ones might work best for your business or personal use. From micro-networking sites like Twitter and Instagram to discussion forums such as Reddit and Quora, each type offers unique advantages depending on what your goals are. Let's dive in! ## Overview of the Diffe",
      "mographic characteristics such as gender, education, income, ethnicity and age. Look for social media platforms popular with your target age group. Be sure to look at both monthly active and daily active users by age. A high percent of Millennials may be monthly users of Facebook but if you look at daily usage they may be spending more time on Instagram. If your target is Gen Y, Snapchat may have the highest daily usage. **Target Audience Psychographics:** Not all people in a generation have the same interests, therefore it is also important to define target audience with psychographic variables such as, values, beliefs and interests. People interested in crafts, fashion, the environment, or gaming may be active on other social media platforms where those interests are popular such as Reddit, Pinterest, Forums or Twitch. **Target Business Category:** Not all purchase decisions are considered in the same social media channels. Therefore also consider type of business. Is the brand B2C or B2B? What industry is it in? Is it a local or national company? Does the brand offer online sales, in-person or a combination of both? The type of business could make other social media channels more relevant to a plan such as LinkedIn, TripAdvisor or Yelp. **Target Communication Objective:** Finally, consider the communications objective. A plan to build brand awareness may work best with Facebook, YouTube and Buzzfeed. A plan to improve customer response may work better in Twitter and Messenger for customer support and Google My Business for customer reviews. A B2B lead generation plan may best leverage Blogs, Podcasts, LinkedIn and Slack. A direct sales plan for a multinational fashion brand could work best with Instagram, Pinterest, WhatsApp and WeChat. Now that you know what to consider in selecting plans. What are the latest social media channels?

      "]( [ Skip to main content ]( Jessie Homewood on the four main categories of social media for the hotel industry. ### Following on from part one in our series ([why social media is so important]( this week we will explore the four main categories of social media platforms and what you can do to get started on your social journey. Social media is a collective term for any digital tool (think websites and applications) that allows people to quickly communicate and interact, share content, and collaborate. People use social media to stay in touch and interact with friends, family and various communities. It encompasses a wide range of websites and apps. Some, like Twitter, specialize in sharing links and short written messages. Others, like Instagram and TikTok, are built to primarily share photos and videos. ## The four main categories of social media platforms for hotels: There are four main categories of social media platforms that are relevant to the hotel industry at present, though these categories shift and change rapidly much like the platforms that are contained within them: ### 1. Social networks Most of us will be familiar with social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn (you're using it right now so I hope you are). People use these networks to connect with one another and share information, thoughts, and ideas. The focus of these networks is usually on the user. User profiles help participants identify other users with common interests or concerns. Facebook is a good example of a social network. So how can social networking sites help your hotel? * Reach potential hotel guests through content and ads: By their very nature, these platforms cultivate large, diverse communities.
