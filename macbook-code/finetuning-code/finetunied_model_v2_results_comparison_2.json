The management levels provided are specific roles such as \"Manager,\" \"Director,\" \"VP,\" etc. Since \"Project Engineer\" does not match any of these predefined management levels, it cannot be classified as such.\n\n2. **Identifying Job Titles**: The term \"Project Engineer\" is a specific job title that indicates a role focused on engineering projects, particularly in the construction field. It does not specify a management level but rather describes a functional role within the engineering domain. Therefore, it should be classified as a job title.\n\n3. **Normalization of Job Title**: The job title \"Project Engineer\" is already concise and to the point, and it does not require any further normalization or modification. It clearly indicates the function without any additional details.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since \"Project Engineer\" is the only key phrase identified and it does not fall under management levels, it will be included in the titles list.\n\nThus, the final output will reflect that there are no management levels identified, but there is one job title: \"Project Engineer.\"\n</rationale>\n<json_output>\n{\n  \"management_levels\": [],\n  \"titles\": [\"Project Engineer\"]\n}\n</json_output>"
