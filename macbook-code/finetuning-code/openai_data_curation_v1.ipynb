    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Management Levels: Only return management levels that match the predefined set: [\"Partners,\",\" \"Founder or Co-founder,\" \"Board of Directors,\" \"CSuite/Chiefs,\" \"Executive VP or Sr. VP,\" \"General Manager,\" \"Manager,\" \"Senior Partner,\" \"Junior Partner,\" \"VP,\" \"Director,\" \"Senior (All Senior-Level Individual Contributors),\" \"Mid (All Mid-Level Individual Contributors),\" \"Junior (All Junior-Level Individual Contributors)\"]. MANAGEMENT CAN ONLY BE FROM THIS PREDEFINED SET, Nothing ELSE.\n",
    "2. Job Titles: Normalize the job title after extracting it from the text. For example, convert \"ceo\" to \"Chief Executive Officer\" and always include both the full title and its abbreviation (confirmed ones), e.g., \"VP of Engineering\" and \"Vice President of Engineering.\" or \"Chief Innovation Officer\" and \"CINO\". ENSURE LOGICAL and EXACT job titles such as 'Architect' NOT 'Architect who is skilled in VR'. Job titles MUST BE CONCISE AND TO THE POINT and shouldn't include company names or region names. Do not change the title for normalization.\n",
    "3. Response Format: Your response must be a dictionary with two keys: \"management_levels\" and \"titles\". Each key should have a list of management levels and titles respectively.\n",
    "4. Identify the key phrases in a prompt. Key phrase is a title and its function, IF THE function is mentioned. If the function would be mentioned, it will be classified as a \"Job Title\". For example, \"CEOs working in Automotive Industry and VP of Engineering of Microsoft\" has the \"CEOs\" and \"VP of Engineering\" as Key Phrases. In this case ONLY VP CANNOT be considered a key phrase. ONLY CONSIDER THE KEY PHRASES MENTIONED, DO NOT ASSUME. Past and current designations dont matter.\n",
    "5. Check whether the KEY PHRASE should be classified as a Job Title or a Management Level. IT SHOULD NEVER BE CLASSIFIED INTO BOTH. This is ESSENTIAL.\n",
    "5. If a key phrase is classified as title, don't include it in the management levels. For example, if \"VP of Engineering\" is classified as title then don't include \"VP\" in management levels. Industry or company names will not be included in job titles.\n",
    "6. If a key phrase is classified as a management level, don't include it in the title. For example, if \"Vice Presidents\" is classified as management level then don't include \"Vice Presidents\" in titles. A job title will ONLY be a title and its business function. No other DETAIL should be added. A Management Level cannot COME FROM WITHIN A JOB TITLE.\n",
    "7. Remember: One instance of a key phrase should be considered for either management level or job title, not both. Each will fall either into management levels or job title but WILL NEVER FALL INTO BOTH. A KEY PHRASE CANNOT BE IN MANAGEMENT LEVELS AND TITLE, BOTH. A Management Level cannot COME FROM WITHIN A JOB TITLE. \n",

This means you are asking for a list of people who occupy the VP rank across various departments or divisions within the company. VPs can cover the complete domain of of 'VP' in management level. The emphasis is on their standing in the organizational hierarchy, regardless of their specific job titles. A management title will only be selected if it covers the complete domain in the predefined set.\n",
    "Job Title Focus: If you were asking about \"VPs\" in terms of job titles, you'd be interested in individuals whose specific title is \"VP\" of a certain business function, such as \"VP of Marketing\" (Marketing is a business function) or \"VP of Engineering\" (Engineering is a business function). If a function is clearly mentioned then it would be JOB TITLE. \"VP of Microsoft\" does NOT have a function (Microsoft is an organization) neither does \"Automotive VPs\" (Automotive can ONLY be an industry).

If a user wants all 'executives', without any business function specified then three management levels will be covered, namely \"CSuite,\" \"Executive VP or Sr. VP\" and \"VP\" so all MUST come.

      "**1. The system's primary objective:**\n",
      "As a system, the primary objective is to facilitate recruitment by efficiently processing queries that specify both management level and job title. This will enable users to find candidates who meet specific criteria, ensuring that the recruitment process is targeted and effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. The rules and constraints for processing the information:**\n",
      "- The query must include both a management level (e.g., Director, VP) and a job title (e.g., Engineering).\n",
      "- The system should only return candidates who have previously held the specified job title and management level.\n",
      "- The search should be limited to candidates who have worked in relevant sectors (e.g., technology firms).\n",
      "- The system must handle variations in title formats (e.g., 'Vice President' vs. 'VP') and synonyms (e.g., 'Engineering' vs. 'Tech').\n",
      "- The query should ignore candidates that do not meet both criteria, ensuring precision in results.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The expected outcomes:**\n",
      "- The system will return a list of candidates who are currently or have been at the specified management level and job title.\n",
      "- Each returned candidate profile will include relevant experience, contact information, and additional qualifications.\n",
      "- Users will be able to refine their search further if needed, such as filtering by additional criteria (e.g., location, years of experience).\n",

      "**Example Query:**\n",
      "\"Find me a Director for Engineering who has previously worked as a VP of a tech firm.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**System Processing Steps:**\n",
      "1. **Input Validation:** The system checks that both 'Director' (management level) and 'Engineering' (job title) are present in the query.\n",
      "2. **Title Normalization:** The system recognizes 'Director' and 'VP' as distinct management levels and identifies variations (e.g., 'Vice President').\n",
      "3. **Candidate Search:** The system searches the database for candidates who directly match the criteria:\n",
      "   - **Current Title:** Director of Engineering.\n",
      "   - **Previous Title:** VP at a technology firm.\n",
      "4. **Sector Filtering:** The system filters candidates to ensure that only those who have worked in technology firms are included.\n",
      "5. **Result Compilation:** The system compiles a list of candidates that meet the criteria, presenting their profiles with relevant details.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Expected Output Example:**\n",
      "- **Candidate 1:**\n",
      "  - Name: John Doe\n",
      "  - Current Position: Director of Engineering at Tech Innovations Inc.\n",
      "  - Previous Position: Vice President of Operations at Future Tech Co.\n",
      "  - Contact: john.doe@email.com\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Candidate 2:**\n",
      "  - Name: Jane Smith\n",
      "  - Current Position: Director of Engineering at NextGen Solutions.\n",
      "  - Previous Position: VP of Product Development at Leading Tech Ltd.\n",
      "  - Contact: jane.smith@email.com\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **\"Executive recruitment\"**: This phrase suggests a focus on hiring for high-level positions, but it doesn't specify a title or management level directly. Since \"executive\" is mentioned, we will not classify it as a management level or a job title.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **\"Operations Director\"**: This is a clear job title that specifies a function (Operations). The title \"Operations Director\" falls under the category of job titles because it indicates a specific role and responsibility within an organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **\"Maghreb\"**: This refers to a geographic region and does not contribute to the classification of management levels or job titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **\"lead production\"** and **\"manage regional operations\"**: These phrases describe functions associated with the job title but do not introduce new key phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's classify the identified key phrases:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Management Levels**: No management levels are identified in this query.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Classify the Key Phrase**: The phrase \"Regional Director of Development\" will be classified as a job title because it specifies a role with a clear business function (Development). The word \"Executive\" in the query does not refer to a specific job title or management level in this context but is more of a descriptor of the type of search being conducted.\n",
