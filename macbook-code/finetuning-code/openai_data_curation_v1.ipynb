    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Management Levels: Only return management levels that match the predefined set: [\"Partners,\",\" \"Founder or Co-founder,\" \"Board of Directors,\" \"CSuite/Chiefs,\" \"Executive VP or Sr. VP,\" \"General Manager,\" \"Manager,\" \"Senior Partner,\" \"Junior Partner,\" \"VP,\" \"Director,\" \"Senior (All Senior-Level Individual Contributors),\" \"Mid (All Mid-Level Individual Contributors),\" \"Junior (All Junior-Level Individual Contributors)\"]. MANAGEMENT CAN ONLY BE FROM THIS PREDEFINED SET, Nothing ELSE.\n",
    "2. Job Titles: Normalize the job title after extracting it from the text. For example, convert \"ceo\" to \"Chief Executive Officer\" and always include both the full title and its abbreviation (confirmed ones), e.g., \"VP of Engineering\" and \"Vice President of Engineering.\" or \"Chief Innovation Officer\" and \"CINO\". ENSURE LOGICAL and EXACT job titles such as 'Architect' NOT 'Architect who is skilled in VR'. Job titles MUST BE CONCISE AND TO THE POINT and shouldn't include company names or region names. Do not change the title for normalization.\n",
    "3. Response Format: Your response must be a dictionary with two keys: \"management_levels\" and \"titles\". Each key should have a list of management levels and titles respectively.\n",
    "4. Identify the key phrases in a prompt. Key phrase is a title and its function, IF THE function is mentioned. If the function would be mentioned, it will be classified as a \"Job Title\". For example, \"CEOs working in Automotive Industry and VP of Engineering of Microsoft\" has the \"CEOs\" and \"VP of Engineering\" as Key Phrases. In this case ONLY VP CANNOT be considered a key phrase. ONLY CONSIDER THE KEY PHRASES MENTIONED, DO NOT ASSUME. Past and current designations dont matter.\n",
    "5. Check whether the KEY PHRASE should be classified as a Job Title or a Management Level. IT SHOULD NEVER BE CLASSIFIED INTO BOTH. This is ESSENTIAL.\n",
    "5. If a key phrase is classified as title, don't include it in the management levels. For example, if \"VP of Engineering\" is classified as title then don't include \"VP\" in management levels. Industry or company names will not be included in job titles.\n",
    "6. If a key phrase is classified as a management level, don't include it in the title. For example, if \"Vice Presidents\" is classified as management level then don't include \"Vice Presidents\" in titles. A job title will ONLY be a title and its business function. No other DETAIL should be added. A Management Level cannot COME FROM WITHIN A JOB TITLE.\n",
    "7. Remember: One instance of a key phrase should be considered for either management level or job title, not both. Each will fall either into management levels or job title but WILL NEVER FALL INTO BOTH. A KEY PHRASE CANNOT BE IN MANAGEMENT LEVELS AND TITLE, BOTH. A Management Level cannot COME FROM WITHIN A JOB TITLE. \n",

This means you are asking for a list of people who occupy the VP rank across various departments or divisions within the company. VPs can cover the complete domain of of 'VP' in management level. The emphasis is on their standing in the organizational hierarchy, regardless of their specific job titles. A management title will only be selected if it covers the complete domain in the predefined set.\n",
    "Job Title Focus: If you were asking about \"VPs\" in terms of job titles, you'd be interested in individuals whose specific title is \"VP\" of a certain business function, such as \"VP of Marketing\" (Marketing is a business function) or \"VP of Engineering\" (Engineering is a business function). If a function is clearly mentioned then it would be JOB TITLE. \"VP of Microsoft\" does NOT have a function (Microsoft is an organization) neither does \"Automotive VPs\" (Automotive can ONLY be an industry).

If a user wants all 'executives', without any business function specified then three management levels will be covered, namely \"CSuite,\" \"Executive VP or Sr. VP\" and \"VP\" so all MUST come.

For example, if 'Marketing Executives' is mentioned, titles such as 'CMO', 'Chief Marketing Officer', 'Senior VP of Marketing', 'Senior Vice President of Marketing', 'VP of Marketing', and 'Vice President of Marketing' should be included.
