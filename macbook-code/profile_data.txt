<about>
I have been developing and launching transformative technologies across healthcare, robotics, and mobility industries; creating safer and more efficient solutions for over 20 years in product, design, and engineering.  Everything I do is motivated from a place of making the world better with the technology that I make and the teams I get to do that with.

My background is in mechanical and controls engineering.  I spent the first half of my career at NASA where I worked on robots that are still driving on the planet Mars today.  I then went on to work at companies in both the health robotics and self driving car spaces.  I've worked in both day one startups as well as large companies who are trying to create a "first of its kind" product.   

As a product and technology leader, I know that great product roadmaps focus on simplicity and scalability.  A tech product doesn't happen overnight.  It takes a lot of experimentation and quick iterations to find the answer.  I believe leaders need to ask the hard questions and push the team to explore new ideas with quick experiments.  My focus as a leader is to build a great team, help set a clear vision so the team knows what the goals are and then give them the resources they need -- the results are beyond what you can imagine.
