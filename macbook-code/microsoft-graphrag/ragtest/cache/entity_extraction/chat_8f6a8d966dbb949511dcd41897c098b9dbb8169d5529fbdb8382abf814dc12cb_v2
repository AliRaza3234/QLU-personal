The list includes publicly held companies, along with privately held companies for which revenues are publicly available. The concept of the Fortune 500 was created by Edgar P. Smith, a Fortune editor, and the first list was published in 1955. The Fortune 500 is more commonly used than its subset Fortune 100 or superset Fortune 1000.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Fortune 500, created by Edgar P. Smith, was first published in January 1955. The original top ten companies were General Motors, Jersey Standard, U.S. Steel, General Electric, Esmark, Chrysler, Armour, Gulf Oil, Mobil, and DuPont.\n\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe original Fortune 500 was limited to companies whose revenues were derived from manufacturing, mining, and energy exploration. At the same time, Fortune published companion \"Fortune 50\" lists of the 50 largest commercial banks (ranked by assets), utilities (ranked by assets), life insurance companies (ranked by assets), retailers (ranked by gross revenues) and transportation companies (ranked by revenues). Fortune magazine changed its methodology in 1994 to include service companies. With the change came 291 new entrants to the famous list including three in the Top 10.\n\n\n== Influence ==\nAs of 2020, the Fortune 500 companies represent approximately two-thirds of the United States' gross domestic product with approximately $14.2 trillion in revenue, $1.2 trillion in profits, and $20.4 trillion in total market value. These revenue figures also account for approximately 18% of the gross world product. The companies collectively employ a total of 29.2 million people worldwide, or nearly 0.4% of the world's total population.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe following is the list of top 20 companies.\n\n\n=== Breakdown by state ===\nThis is the list of the top 18 states with the most companies within the Fortune 500 as of 2024.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nFull list of Fortune 500 companies: 1955â2005, 2006, 2007, 2008,  2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022\n\n\n**Title**:\nList of largest companies in the United States by revenue\n**Content**:\nThis list comprises the largest companies currently in the United States by revenue as of 2024, according to the Fortune 500 tally of companies and Forbes.\nThe Fortune 500 list of companies includes only publicly traded companies, also including tax inversion companies. There are also corporations having foundation in the United States, such as corporate headquarters, operational headquarters and independent subsidiaries. The list excludes large privately held companies such as Cargill and Koch Industries whose financial data is not necessarily available to the public. However, this list does include several government-sponsored enterprises that were created by acts of Congress and later became publicly traded.\n\n\n== List of the largest public / publicly traded companies ==\nBelow are the 100 largest companies by revenue in 2024 (mostly for fiscal year 2023), according to the Fortune 500 list.\n\n\n== List of largest private companies ==\nBelow are the 10 largest private companies by revenue in 2023 (mostly for fiscal year 2022), according to Forbes.\n\n\n== List of companies by profit ==\nThe 10 most profitable companies in 2024 according to the Fortune 500.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of companies of the United States by state\nList of largest companies by revenue\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n**Title**:\nFortune Global 500\n**Content**:\nThe Fortune Global 500, also known as Global 500, is an annual ranking of the top 500 corporations worldwide as measured by revenue. The list is compiled and published annually by Fortune magazine.\n\n\n== Methodology ==\nUntil 1989, it listed only nonâUnited States industrial corporations under the title \"International 500\" while the Fortune 500 contained and still contains exclusively United States corporations. In 1990, United States companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.\nSeveral inconsistencies exist in Fortune's ranking of cities with the most Fortune 500 headquarters. On June 3, 2011, the Atlanta Business Chronicle stated examples of Fortune including regional headquarters for some cities, excluding regional headquarters for other cities and in some cases excluding headquarters that are physically located inside a city limit.\n\n\n== Geographical distribution ==\nSince 2001, there has been significant change in the geographical distribution of the companies in the Global 500 rankings. Most of this growth is accounted for by a rapid increase in the number of Chinese Global 500 companies, of which there were 135 by 2021, increasing from only 10 in 2001. The share of European-based companies also declined, from 158 to 143, over the same period.\n\n\n== Fortune Global 500 list of 2023 ==\nThe following is the list of Top 10 companies in 2023:\n\n\n=== Breakdown by country/territory ===\nThese are the Top 10 countries/territories with the highest revenues from the Top 500 companies as of August 2023:\n\n\n=== Breakdown by region ===\nAs of August 2023, 28 (6%) of the Fortune Global 500 companies are located outside\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
